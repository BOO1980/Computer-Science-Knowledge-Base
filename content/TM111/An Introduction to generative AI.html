  <h1>1.2.1 - An Introduction to generative AI</h1>
  <h2>Examples of AI in everyday life</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Lots of us have been interacting with AI in various ways for years (sometimes without realising it). </li>
    <li>Examples of AI in everyday life <ul>
        <li>Digital assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa)</li>
        <li>Recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix, Amazon)</li>
        <li>Chatbots: used for customer service (shopping, banking, booking a holiday, tech support)</li>
        <li>Facial recognition technology (e.g., unlocking phones, security systems)</li>
        <li>Music and Media streaming services: (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music) Use AI to recommend songs and create
          playlists.</li>
        <li>Online shopping: personalized product recommendations</li>
        <li>Travel and navigation: (e.g., Google Maps, Waze) Use AI to provide real-time traffic updates and suggest
          the best routes.</li>
        <li>Writing assistance: (e.g., Grammarly, Google Docs) Use AI to help with grammar, style, and content
          suggestions.</li>
        <li>Health and Fitness apps: (e.g., MyFitnessPal, Fitbit) Use AI to provide personalized workout and nutrition
          recommendations.</li>
        <li>Social media feeds: Use AI to curate content and suggest posts based on user preferences.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What is generative AI?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Generative AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content, such as text, images,
      music, or even videos, based on the data it has been trained on.</li>
    <li>Unlike traditional AI systems that are designed to perform specific tasks, generative AI models can generate
      original content that mimics human creativity.</li>
    <li>Generative AI uses techniques such as deep learning and neural networks to analyze large datasets and learn
      patterns, structures, and relationships within the data.</li>
    <li>Once trained, these models can produce new content by sampling from the learned patterns and generating outputs
      that are similar to the training data but not identical.</li>
    <li>Examples of generative AI include language models like GPT-3 (which powers ChatGPT), image generation models
      like DALL-E, and music generation models like OpenAI's MuseNet.</li>
    <li>It is a type of AI technology that automatically generates (or creates) content in response to prompts given to
      it by users</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How does it work</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Generative AI works by training on large datasets to learn patterns and structures within the data.</li>
    <li>LLMs have been trained on vast amounts of data from webpages, social media conversations, and other online
      content to generate human-like responses to our prompts. These tools can continuously update with new data by
      collecting our previous questions and prompts.</li>
    <li>Generative AI tools that deal with text are called Large language models (LLMs).</li>
    <li>LLMs are designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input they receive.</li>
    <li>LLMs such as ChatGPT work like predictive text, except the algorithms are more sophisticated. </li>
    <li>They create content based on recognized patterns. e.g what word or phrase is most likely to come next, rather
      than knowing what the words or phrases mean.</li>
    <li>You can provide these tools with a prompt about almost any topic and they will respond in fluent English as well
      as many other languages, often sounding surprisingly knowledgeable, or with an image/computing code snippet.</li>
    <li>Although outputs produced by Generative AI tool look plausible, they are often misleading, made up or maybe
      entirely wrong.</li>
    <li>Each response is unique, you will never get the same reply twice</li>

    <li>Responses are conversationbal, once you have asked a question you can just carry on the conversation by adding
      new questions or prompts, rather than having to redo your search, as you would in a search engine like google</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What is generative AI? AI that creates content based on user prompts.</li>
    <li>Which of the following is a text generative AI tool? ChatGPT</li>
    <li>Which of the following is an example of AI Technology used in everyday life? Using a chatbot for customer
      service.</li>
    <li>Why might responses from generative AI tools be misleading? Because they rely on pattern recognitions rather
      than understanding context.</li>
    <li>How do Large Language Models (LLMs) generate responses? By recongnizing patterns in vast amounts of data</li>
  </ul>
