    <h1>TMA01</h1>
    <H2>Question 1</H2>
    <p>a: In Part 1 and part two of block one, we recommended that you take notes. Wrote a few sentences describing how
        you take notes on TM 11, including how you organize and store them. [<em>The word limit for question 1 a is 70
            words.</em>]</p>
    <p>I built a local website as a personal knowledge base to keep all my notes in one place. Organized into folders
        and pages with a keyword index and useful links, it helps me connect ideas, track to-dos, and access resources
        easily. Linking notes and references lets me mind-map topics, deepen understanding, and keep my knowledge base
        clear, engaging, and easy to navigate. (62)</p>
