  <h1>1.2 Some aspects of our digital world</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>will look at how it affects business,
      information, entertainment, public services and communication</li>
    <li>
  </ul>
  <h2>1.2.1 - Business</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Every time you use a debit or credit card in a shop, the shop till communicates with a card
      terminal that transmits your identification details from your card to your bank or credit card
      company for verification.</li>
    <li>Your balance is then adjusted according to your purchase. A
      similar chain of events is initiated if you shop online (buying a plane or train ticket,
      perhaps) or over the phone (when buying a cinema ticket, for example).</li>
    <li>Many banks also provide online banking services, reducing the need for customers to visit a branch.</li>
    <li>Automated teller machines (ATMs) allow you to check your bank balance and withdraw
      cash wherever you are in the world.</li>
    <li>In each of the above situations – using a debit or
      credit card, shopping or managing your money online or over the phone, or using an ATM
      – the machines involved are connected via a network to a central computer which has
      records of your account in an electronic filing system known as a database</li>
    <li>Financial services have undergone huge changes in recent years as a result of
      developments in the digital technologies driving them.</li>
    <li>The examples just described show
      how convenient and accessible such services have become. Yet at the same time, issues
      of identity and security have become a concern</li>
    <li>New online ways of communicating have
      also created new types of crime, including identity theft and digital financial fraud. In turn,
      these problems have fostered the development of new security industries that try to inform
      us and sell us solutions to reduce the chances of us becoming victims of online crime.</li>
    <li>Also, this move towards online services means that banks have closed many branches,
      leading to job losses.</li>
    <li>This is particularly difficult for customers who prefer to use
      branches, especially those living in rural areas.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Commerce</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Advances in digital technologies have led to changes in many areas of commerce, with
      some existing kinds of business being transformed by the opportunities these
      developments offer</li>
    <li>One of the most obvious changes is the emergence of retailers such
      as Amazon, which at one stage was entirely online with no physical shop that customers
      can visit</li>
    <li>Yet the internet not only benefits the largest companies, but also allows even the
      smallest retailers to advertise their services to a global audience</li>
    <li>Specialised companies
      can flourish by harnessing the internet’s immense reach to deliver to potential customers</li>
    <li>High-street shops specialising in items such as books, DVDs, music
      and games have all lost business to online retailers</li>
    <li>This has driven some shops out of
      business, but a number of them have also opened successful online stores.</li>
    <li>Online
      retailers have lower costs – they don’t pay expensive high-street rents and can easily be
      based in countries with low tax regimes – and they can pass these savings on to
      customers</li>
    <li>There are other concerns about these large online retailers, such as the
      employment terms and conditions of warehouse workers</li>
    <li>Although the low costs offered by online stores can be very attractive to customers, they
      might be counterbalanced to some extent by the less immediate and less tangible nature
      of the shopping experience</li>
    <li>owever, online retailers try to make up for this by providing a
      variety of services that reassure and inform their customers. One such service is the
      tracking of goods online</li>
    <li>This allows customers to see where their order is in the delivery process and
      when it is likely to arrive</li>
    <li>Online retailers may try to address the disadvantages listed above in various ways. For instance, they might
      provide. <ul>
        <li>Free collection of returned items. </li>
        <li>Links to online reviews of products to help advise prospective buyers. </li>
        <li>Telephone help lines. </li>
        <li>Support forums to help customers before and after buying. </li>
        <li>Advice on how to shop safely online </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>As well as direct retailing of the types of business have also moved online. </li>
    <li>Auction sites such as eBay fall into this category. </li>
    <li>Some online businesses are less conventional, and as a result, it's often harder to see how they find the money
      they need to survive. </li>
    <li>For example, there are many collaborative projects that produce free products, including software, online
      encyclopedias, and educational resources. </li>
    <li>They these often rely on volunteers contributing their time, with money being provided by advertising,
      sponsorship
      or donations. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Activity 1.5</h3>
  <p>Add some more entries to the following table of advantages and disadvantages of
    online shopping. Can you think of ways in which online retailers may try to address the
    disadvantages?
  </p>
  <p>Answer: When shopping online you cannot really see/feel the quality of the product before buying it. Online
    retailers
    may try to address this by providing detailed product descriptions, high-quality images, and customer reviews to
    help
    shoppers make informed decisions.</p>
  <h3>Work</h3>
  <ul>Technology has changed the way that other businesses operate, too.
    <li>Greater quantities of information are exchanged between numerous locations over public and private networks.
    </li>
    <li>Fast amounts of data are stored on computer and access remotely from a variety of devices. </li>
    <li>Many companies now use data centers or centralized groups of network computer servers that specialized in the
      storage, processing, and distribution of large amounts of data. </li>
    <li>Just as individuals buy from companies online, many companies now sell to each other online as well,For the same
      reasons of reduced cost and wider choice that attract individuals to online stores. </li>
    <li>Manufacturing tasks that used to take days can now be completed in minutes using computer operating machine
      tours
      working in automated production lines. </li>
    <li>The way we use technology has also affected our individual working lives. For example, the role of travel agents
      have changed as more people book the holidays directly from the vendor by going online. </li>
    <li>Some companies have responded by reducing their number of employees, while others have retrained their staff to
      provide more specialized services to their customers. </li>
    <li>More genuinely, many people working in an office environment are expected to learn how to use new software
      applications in order to do their jobs. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>1.2.2 - Communities, information and entertainment</h2>
  <h3>Communities. </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>As well as revolutionizing the commerce world, the Internet has had enormous impacting on the way we
      communicate.
    </li>
    <li>While there are still people in many parts of the world who do not have Internet, access, many of us have access
      at home or at work. </li>
    <li>As a result, we have the opportunity to communicate with others using email, instant messaging and online
      discussion groups. </li>
    <li>I. Existing communities have created new ways of communicating and new online communities have developed. </li>
    <li>Social networking plays an increasingly significant role in the lives of many people. </li>
    <li>The recent pace of communication changes amazed many of us and there is no reason to think it will slow down.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The Internet has had a huge impact on the availability of information of all kinds. </li>
    <li>Material on the web reflects widely different viewpoints, from official news bulletins to unofficial rumors, and
      comes from widely differing sources. From commercial megastores to community groups. </li>
    <li>Since no individual, government, company or person that has control over it, the Internet has paved the way to
      unfettered publishing of information of all kinds, raising questions about the authority and regulation of this
      information. </li>
    <li>As you will learn in your studies, some governments try to exert control over the information their citizens can
      access and create, with varying degrees of success. </li>
    <li>The widely used online encyclopedia Wikipedia, for example, contains millions of articles, many of high quality
      scholarship. But there are also articles that are of suspect quality and might even be deliberately misleading.
    </li>
    <li>Its greatest strength is also its great this weakness in that anyone with an Internet connection can edit its
      pages. </li>
    <li>The Excel copied to itself advises users to treat precaution. Anyone, single source, whatever the media or
      multiple works that derive from a single source. </li>
    <li>The ever increasing volume of online information available on the web means it is important to think critically
      about what you find. Especially if you are going to use it for study or work purposes. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Entertainment</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The world of entertainment is constantly evolving as new ways of creating and distributing the media we watch
      and
      listen to are developed. </li>
    <li>Digital broadcasting has changed the way we experience television and radio, with increasingly interactive and
      participative programs. </li>
    <li>Digital cameras, printers and scanners, together with desktop publishing and photo editing software, enable
      greater numbers of people to experiment with image production, while online image and video sharing sites allow
      anyone with access to a relatively basic mobile phone or digital camera to share photos and videos with the rest
      of
      the online world. </li>
    <li>New digital technologies have also been on the forefront of changes in the production and distribution of music,
      and computer gaming has developed hand in hand with the evolution of graphical interfaces. </li>
    <li>However, I increased exposure to digital entertainment has resulted in increased conflict between the rights of
      the consumer and the rights of the producer of the media. </li>
    <li>It is now much easier for the products of the media industries established during the 20th century, film, music
      and so on, to be legally copied and distributed in a form that is indistinguishable from the original. </li>
    <li>Orders are taking steps to prevent these by developing a range of digital rights management techniques that make
      it much harder to create copies, as well as by trying to persuade users of the benefits of the original product.
    </li>
    <li>Such attempts at persuasion can look very threatening, as I noticed on a recently purchased CD that has the
      following printed on the back cover. FBI anti piracy Warning Unauthorized copying is punishable under federal law.
    </li>
    <li>Several questions come to mind when I read this. Does that mean I can't legally put the music on to my MP3
      player?
      Copying from one format to another is legal in the USA, but although the law is under review, it's not legal in
      the
      UK at present. Although people in the UK are not deterred from doing it. </li>
    <li>Copyrighted very much a live issue in the UK and the US at present. There are many other issues arising from
      this
      and it's very easy to make the digital future sound bleak. </li>
    <li>You may have heard predictions to the effect that illegally copied media and make any information freely
      available
      on the web puts whole businesses and hundreds of thousands of jobs in the established media industrials at risks.
    </li>
    <li>However, as in other areas of the digital world, there are also opportunities for these businesses if they can
      adapt to the new environment and modify their business modules to survive and grow in different directions. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>1.2.3 Public information and services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Public bodies such as governments and transport agencies are recently providing services online, allowing us to
      organize various aspects of our daily lives more easily.
    </li>
    <li>These services range from information displays, which let us check things such as weather forecasts and
      transport
      times tables, to interactive sites that allow us to make bookings or queries. </li>
    <li>In many parts of the world, medical records are increasingly moving away from paper and X-ray film towards
      becoming completely digital.
    <li>This has several advantages, especially in allowing patient records to be easily shared between departments
      within
      a hospital, and sometimes more widely with doctors, surgeries and other health workers. </li>
    <li>In most parts of the UK doctors and nurses walk around wards with tablet computers and other forms of handheld
      devices instead of files and clipboards. </li>
    <li>In remote rural areas of some countries, doctors can make use of computer networks or even mobile phones to make
      a
      diagnosis if they are unable to see the patient in person. </li>
    <li>However, this is by no means universal, and even where such facilities exist, though aren't always available.
    </li>
    <li>Information for travelers is also increasingly being made available digitally, for example live on layer updates
      on road congestion and public transports, and arrival information in station and airports. </li>
    <li>Similarly, most people book plane journeys online. In fact, some airlines now only accept online bookings and
      want
      to only issue electronic tickets. </li>
    <li>Many of them require or strongly encourage passengers to check in online as well. You can track the locations of
      airplanes in real time using apps such as Flightaware and Flightradar 24. </li>
    <li>In addition, many countries provide online access to at least some of their government services. For example,
      you
      might be able to renew or apply for a passport book, a driving test, claim benefits, or filling your tax return
      online. </li>

    <li>Local authorities also provide digital Information Services. Usually you are able to reserve or renew a book
      online, for instance. And there are numerous opportunities to learn online as you will be doing on TM111. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changing Internet use overtime. </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The Office for National Statistics have been collecting statistics on the use of Internet since 1988 and has
      produced an annual report since 2006 based on service of people in the UK. </li>
    <li>The most recent survey at the time of writing shows a huge increase in the use of the Internet and social media
      since their first annual report. These are the key findings: <ul>
        <li>The Internet was used daily or almost daily by 82% of adults. (41.8 million) In Great
          Britain in 2016 compared with 78% (39.3 million) in 2015 and 35% (16.2 million) in 2006. </li>
        <li>In 2016, seventy percent of adults access the Internet on the go using a mobile phone or smartphone, up from
          66% in 2015 and nearly double the 2011 estimate of 36%. </li>
        <li>Analysis of the use of Smart TV show that 21% of adults use them to connect to the Internet in 2000 and 16%
          in
          2016. </li>
        <li>In 2016, 77% of adults brought goods or services online, up from 53% in 2008, but only up 1% from 2015.
        </li>
        <li>Clothes or sports goods were purchased by 54% of adults, making them the most popular online purchase in
          2016.
        </li>
        <li>In 2016, 89% of households in Great Britain (23.7 million) had Internet access, an increase from 86% in 2015
          and 57% in 2006. </li>
      </UL>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>1.2.4 Security and risk. </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The 20th century saw dramatic change in the role of the state in many countries. </li>
    <li>During most of the 19th century, an individual might have come into contact with the state for the purpose of
      taxation, marriage and death. At the end of that century, in the beginning of the next, however, a series of
      social
      revolutions saw the state becoming involved in our health care, pensions and education. </li>
    <li>Unsurprisingly, each of these developments were accompanied by significant increase in the amount of personal
      information stored about every one of us. </li>
    <li>Computer technologies were developed especially to serve the enormous projects involved. </li>
    <li>IBM became a highly successful company due to its work on censuses in the USA and Europe. Was the world's first
      business computer. Leo was used for a variety of tasks, including the calculation of tax tables for the UK
      Treasury
      in the 1950s. </li>
    <li>With the vast amount of personal information being held about us in various places, it is becoming increasingly
      important for us to be able to prove our identities. </li>
    <li>Not just for travel. But for other activities, such as purchasing expensive or restricted items, paying bills
      and
      opening bank accounts. </li>

    <li>The UK's unusual in Europe in that it does not have a compulsory Identity card system. Despite the fact that
      identity cards were put in place during both world Wars. </li>
    <li>However, effectively driving license packs, reports and some types of travel pass have become forms of identity
      card. </li>
    <li>In several countries. Identity card or passport schemes are being upgraded with new biometric technologies such
      as
      iris or face recognition, which claim to identify individuals uniquely. </li>
    <li>As well as the personal information that we know about, there may also exist information about us which we are
      unaware. </li>
    <li>Since the terrorist attack on the USA in 2001, much of the Western world have become far more security
      conscious.
      And governments and companies alike are developed and deployed technological countermeasures. </li>
    <li>These range from smart video surveillance systems that can identify an individual in the crowd and track his or
      her movements, through to the biometric technologies mentioned above, to searching of databases for suspicious
      activity. </li>
    <li>The promise is that such technologies will make us safer. But could they turn the world we live in to a
      society's
      strange, reminiscent of the nightmare vision of Big Brother contained in George Orwell's novel 1984? </li>
    <li>There is plenty of opportunity for digital information about us to be created. Some of this information we might
      intentionally give out ourselves on social networking sites, for example. </li>
    <li>Other information about us, as described above, be gathered more surreptitiously by various agencies. </li>
    <li>In general. We have. Little control over how digital information about us is used or who receives it. </li>
    <li>We might assume that information gathered legally by government agency, for instance, will be handled
      approximately and used only for our benefit. Yet there have been many examples of governments and private
      organization losing confidential data by storing it or transferring insecurely.
    </li>
    <li>For example, in 2015, the communication company Talk Talk was forced to issue a warning to its customers that
      their data has been hacked and that the criminals were using stolen information to trick people into handing over
      their bank details. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>1.2.5 Communicating on the move. </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Advances in digital technology have, in a very short space of time, revolutionize the way many of us live our
      lives. </li>
    <li>Nowhere is this more evident than in our ability to municate as we travel. </li>
    <li>When I first moved away from home, can we catering with my parents involved to share payphone in the hallway or
      a telephone box at the corner of the street? Nowadays I have a mobile with this I can send and pick up emails
      quickly and cheaply wherever I am. </li>
    <li.>As well as email, my phone enables me to communicate in several other ways. Instant messaging and social
      networking for example. Not to mention voice calls. </li>
      <li>I can also use the built in global positioning system to find out where I am. And can even plot my location on
        a website to let my friends and family see where I am, or at least see where my phone is. </li>
  </ul>
