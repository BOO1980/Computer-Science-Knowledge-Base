  <h1>1.2 Some aspects of our digital world</h1>
</body>
<ul>
  <li>will look at how it affects business,
    information, entertainment, public services and communication</li>
  <li>
</ul>
<h2>1.2.1 - Business</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Every time you use a debit or credit card in a shop, the shop till communicates with a card
    terminal that transmits your identification details from your card to your bank or credit card
    company for verification.</li>
  <li>Your balance is then adjusted according to your purchase. A
    similar chain of events is initiated if you shop online (buying a plane or train ticket,
    perhaps) or over the phone (when buying a cinema ticket, for example).</li>
  <li>Many banks also provide online banking services, reducing the need for customers to visit a branch.</li>
  <li>Automated teller machines (ATMs) allow you to check your bank balance and withdraw
    cash wherever you are in the world.</li>
  <li>In each of the above situations – using a debit or
    credit card, shopping or managing your money online or over the phone, or using an ATM
    – the machines involved are connected via a network to a central computer which has
    records of your account in an electronic filing system known as a database</li>
  <li>Financial services have undergone huge changes in recent years as a result of
    developments in the digital technologies driving them.</li>
  <li>The examples just described show
    how convenient and accessible such services have become. Yet at the same time, issues
    of identity and security have become a concern</li>
  <li>New online ways of communicating have
    also created new types of crime, including identity theft and digital financial fraud. In turn,
    these problems have fostered the development of new security industries that try to inform
    us and sell us solutions to reduce the chances of us becoming victims of online crime.</li>
  <li>Also, this move towards online services means that banks have closed many branches,
    leading to job losses.</li>
  <li>This is particularly difficult for customers who prefer to use
    branches, especially those living in rural areas.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commerce</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Advances in digital technologies have led to changes in many areas of commerce, with
    some existing kinds of business being transformed by the opportunities these
    developments offer</li>
  <li>One of the most obvious changes is the emergence of retailers such
    as Amazon, which at one stage was entirely online with no physical shop that customers
    can visit</li>
  <li>Yet the internet not only benefits the largest companies, but also allows even the
    smallest retailers to advertise their services to a global audience</li>
  <li>Specialised companies
    can flourish by harnessing the internet’s immense reach to deliver to potential customers</li>
  <li>High-street shops specialising in items such as books, DVDs, music
    and games have all lost business to online retailers</li>
  <li>This has driven some shops out of
    business, but a number of them have also opened successful online stores.</li>
  <li>Online
    retailers have lower costs – they don’t pay expensive high-street rents and can easily be
    based in countries with low tax regimes – and they can pass these savings on to
    customers</li>
  <li>There are other concerns about these large online retailers, such as the
    employment terms and conditions of warehouse workers</li>
  <li>Although the low costs offered by online stores can be very attractive to customers, they
    might be counterbalanced to some extent by the less immediate and less tangible nature
    of the shopping experience</li>
  <li>owever, online retailers try to make up for this by providing a
    variety of services that reassure and inform their customers. One such service is the
    tracking of goods online</li>
  <li>This allows customers to see where their order is in the delivery process and
    when it is likely to arrive</li>
  <li>Online retailers may try to address the disadvantages listed above in various ways. For instance, they might
    provide. <ul>
      <li>Free collection of returned items. </li>
      <li>Links to online reviews of products to help advise prospective buyers. </li>
      <li>Telephone help lines. </li>
      <li>Support forums to help customers before and after buying. </li>
      <li>Advice on how to shop safely online </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>As well as direct retailing of the types of business have also moved online. </li>
  <li>Auction sites such as eBay fall into this category. </li>
  <li>Some online businesses are less conventional, and as a result, it's often harder to see how they find the money
    they need to survive. </li>
  <li>For example, there are many collaborative projects that produce free products, including software, online
    encyclopedias, and educational resources. </li>
  <li>They these often rely on volunteers contributing their time, with money being provided by advertising, sponsorship
    or donations. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Activity 1.5</h3>
<p>Add some more entries to the following table of advantages and disadvantages of
  online shopping. Can you think of ways in which online retailers may try to address the
  disadvantages?
</p>
<p>Answer: When shopping online you cannot really see/feel the quality of the product before buying it. Online retailers
  may try to address this by providing detailed product descriptions, high-quality images, and customer reviews to help
  shoppers make informed decisions.</p>
<h3>Work</h3>
<ul>Technology has changed the way that other businesses operate, too.
  <li>Greater quantities of information are exchanged between numerous locations over public and private networks. </li>
  <li>Fast amounts of data are stored on computer and access remotely from a variety of devices. </li>
  <li>Many companies now use data centers or centralized groups of network computer servers that specialized in the
    storage, processing, and distribution of large amounts of data. </li>
  <li>Just as individuals buy from companies online, many companies now sell to each other online as well,For the same
    reasons of reduced cost and wider choice that attract individuals to online stores. </li>
  <li>Manufacturing tasks that used to take days can now be completed in minutes using computer operating machine tours
    working in automated production lines. </li>
  <li>The way we use technology has also affected our individual working lives. For example, the role of travel agents
    have changed as more people book the holidays directly from the vendor by going online. </li>
  <li>Some companies have responded by reducing their number of employees, while others have retrained their staff to
    provide more specialized services to their customers. </li>
  <li>More genuinely, many people working in an office environment are expected to learn how to use new software
    applications in order to do their jobs. </li>
</ul>
<h2>1.2.2 - Communities, information and entertainment</h2>
<h3>Communities. </h3>
<ul>
  <li>As well as revolutionizing the commerce world, the Internet has had enormous impacting on the way we communicate.
  </li>
  <li>While there are still people in many parts of the world who do not have Internet, access, many of us have access
    at home or at work. </li>
  <li>As a result, we have the opportunity to communicate with others using email, instant messaging and online
    discussion groups. </li>
  <li>I. Existing communities have created new ways of communicating and new online communities have developed. </li>
  <li>Social networking plays an increasingly significant role in the lives of many people. </li>
  <li>The recent pace of communication changes amazed many of us and there is no reason to think it will slow down.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Information</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Internet has had a huge impact on the availability of information of all kinds. </li>
  <li>Material on the web reflects widely different viewpoints, from official news bulletins to unofficial rumors, and
    comes from widely differing sources. From commercial megastores to community groups. </li>
  <li>Since no individual, government, company or person that has control over it, the Internet has paved the way to
    unfettered publishing of information of all kinds, raising questions about the authority and regulation of this
    information. </li>
  <li>As you will learn in your studies, some governments try to exert control over the information their citizens can
    access and create, with varying degrees of success. </li>
  <li>The widely used online encyclopedia Wikipedia, for example, contains millions of articles, many of high quality
    scholarship. But there are also articles that are of suspect quality and might even be deliberately misleading.
  </li>
  <li>Its greatest strength is also its great this weakness in that anyone with an Internet connection can edit its
    pages. </li>
  <li>The Excel copied to itself advises users to treat precaution. Anyone, single source, whatever the media or
    multiple works that derive from a single source. </li>
  <li>The ever increasing volume of online information available on the web means it is important to think critically
    about what you find. Especially if you are going to use it for study or work purposes. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Entertainment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The world of entertainment is constantly evolving as new ways of creating and distributing the media we watch and
    listen to are developed. </li>
  <li>Digital broadcasting has changed the way we experience television and radio, with increasingly interactive and
    participative programs. </li>
  <li>Digital cameras, printers and scanners, together with desktop publishing and photo editing software, enable
    greater numbers of people to experiment with image production, while online image and video sharing sites allow
    anyone with access to a relatively basic mobile phone or digital camera to share photos and videos with the rest of
    the online world. </li>
  <li>New digital technologies have also been on the forefront of changes in the production and distribution of music,
    and computer gaming has developed hand in hand with the evolution of graphical interfaces. </li>
  <li>However, I increased exposure to digital entertainment has resulted in increased conflict between the rights of
    the consumer and the rights of the producer of the media. </li>
  <li>It is now much easier for the products of the media industries established during the 20th century, film, music
    and so on, to be legally copied and distributed in a form that is indistinguishable from the original. </li>
  <li>Orders are taking steps to prevent these by developing a range of digital rights management techniques that make
    it much harder to create copies, as well as by trying to persuade users of the benefits of the original product.
  </li>
  <li>Such attempts at persuasion can look very threatening, as I noticed on a recently purchased CD that has the
    following printed on the back cover. FBI anti piracy Warning Unauthorized copying is punishable under federal law.
  </li>
  <li>Several questions come to mind when I read this. Does that mean I can't legally put the music on to my MP3 player?
    Copying from one format to another is legal in the USA, but although the law is under review, it's not legal in the
    UK at present. Although people in the UK are not deterred from doing it. </li>
  <li>Copyrighted very much a live issue in the UK and the US at present. There are many other issues arising from this
    and it's very easy to make the digital future sound bleak. </li>
  <li>You may have heard predictions to the effect that illegally copied media and make any information freely available
    on the web puts whole businesses and hundreds of thousands of jobs in the established media industrials at risks.
  </li>
  <li>However, as in other areas of the digital world, there are also opportunities for these businesses if they can
    adapt to the new environment and modify their business modules to survive and grow in different directions. </li>
</ul>
