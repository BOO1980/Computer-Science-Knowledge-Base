  <h1>1.2 Some aspects of our digital world</h1>
</body>
<ul>
  <li>will look at how it affects business,
    information, entertainment, public services and communication</li>
  <li>
</ul>
<h2>1.2.1 Business</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Every time you use a debit or credit card in a shop, the shop till communicates with a card
    terminal that transmits your identification details from your card to your bank or credit card
    company for verification.</li>
  <li>Your balance is then adjusted according to your purchase. A
    similar chain of events is initiated if you shop online (buying a plane or train ticket,
    perhaps) or over the phone (when buying a cinema ticket, for example).</li>
  <li>Many banks also provide online banking services, reducing the need for customers to visit a branch.</li>
  <li>Automated teller machines (ATMs) allow you to check your bank balance and withdraw
    cash wherever you are in the world.</li>
  <li>In each of the above situations – using a debit or
    credit card, shopping or managing your money online or over the phone, or using an ATM
    – the machines involved are connected via a network to a central computer which has
    records of your account in an electronic filing system known as a database</li>
  <li>Financial services have undergone huge changes in recent years as a result of
    developments in the digital technologies driving them.</li>
  <li>The examples just described show
    how convenient and accessible such services have become. Yet at the same time, issues
    of identity and security have become a concern</li>
  <li>New online ways of communicating have
    also created new types of crime, including identity theft and digital financial fraud. In turn,
    these problems have fostered the development of new security industries that try to inform
    us and sell us solutions to reduce the chances of us becoming victims of online crime.</li>
  <li>Also, this move towards online services means that banks have closed many branches,
    leading to job losses.</li>
  <li>This is particularly difficult for customers who prefer to use
    branches, especially those living in rural areas.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.2.2 Commerce</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Advances in digital technologies have led to changes in many areas of commerce, with
    some existing kinds of business being transformed by the opportunities these
    developments offer</li>
  <li>One of the most obvious changes is the emergence of retailers such
    as Amazon, which at one stage was entirely online with no physical shop that customers
    can visit</li>
  <li>Yet the internet not only benefits the largest companies, but also allows even the
    smallest retailers to advertise their services to a global audience</li>
  <li>Specialised companies
    can flourish by harnessing the internet’s immense reach to deliver to potential customers</li>
  <li>High-street shops specialising in items such as books, DVDs, music
    and games have all lost business to online retailers</li>
  <li>This has driven some shops out of
    business, but a number of them have also opened successful online stores.</li>
  <li>Online
    retailers have lower costs – they don’t pay expensive high-street rents and can easily be
    based in countries with low tax regimes – and they can pass these savings on to
    customers</li>
  <li>There are other concerns about these large online retailers, such as the
    employment terms and conditions of warehouse workers</li>
  <li>Although the low costs offered by online stores can be very attractive to customers, they
    might be counterbalanced to some extent by the less immediate and less tangible nature
    of the shopping experience</li>
  <li>owever, online retailers try to make up for this by providing a
    variety of services that reassure and inform their customers. One such service is the
    tracking of goods online</li>
  <li>This allows customers to see where their order is in the delivery process and
    when it is likely to arrive</li>

</ul>
<h3>Activity 1.5</h3>
<p>Add some more entries to the following table of advantages and disadvantages of
  online shopping. Can you think of ways in which online retailers may try to address the
  disadvantages?
</p>
<p>Answer: When shopping online you cannot really see/feel the quality of the product before buying it. Online retailers
  may try to address this by providing detailed product descriptions, high-quality images, and customer reviews to help
  shoppers make informed decisions.</p>
