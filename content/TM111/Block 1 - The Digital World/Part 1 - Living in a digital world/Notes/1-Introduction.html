  <h1>Introducing Part 1</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>You will learn about the historical development of communication technologies and computers and their role in
      today's society</li>
    <li>You will consider examples of digital technologies in the world around you and their influence on your life</li>
    <li>You will need to know that a digital technology is any technolgoy based on representing data as sequences of
      numbers</li>
    <li>In this module, the term dgital world refers to the influence of computer on the world, in a wide variety of
      forms, linked by communications networks</li>
    <li>Most of the use of technology that you'll consider will be legal and harmless</li>
    <li>However you will also look at some examples that subvert laws and the rights of others</li>
    <li>Some examples will move into the worlds of crime and terror, where information is transmitted that others want
      to intercept, control or suppress</li>
    <li>Effective participation in the digital world therefore requires you to become aware of many technical, social
      and ethical pitfalls, as well as some ways you can avoid them</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Activity 1.2 - How digital is your world?</h1>
  <p>Can you think of another technology that has made the transition from novelty to common place?</p>
  <p>Consider how this technology has changed the way you live, work, or communicate. Reflect on its impact on society
    and whether it has become an essential part of daily life.</p>
  <p>Discuss your thoughts with others or write a short paragraph summarizing your views.</p>
  <h2>Answer</h2>
  <p>One example of a technology that has transitioned from novelty to commonplace is the GPS. Initially, GPS devices
    were expensive and primarily used by the military. However, with advancements in technology and the integration of
    GPS into smartphones, it has become an essential tool for navigation in everyday life.</p>
  <p>GPS has transformed how we travel, allowing for real-time navigation, traffic updates, and location sharing. It has
    also influenced various industries, such as logistics and transportation, by optimizing routes and improving
    efficiency.</p>
  <p>Overall, GPS has become a ubiquitous technology that enhances convenience and connectivity in our digital world.
  </p>
  <h3>Advantages of GPS</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Real-time navigation and traffic updates</li>
    <li>Location sharing with friends and family</li>
    <li>Improved efficiency in logistics and transportation</li>
    <li>Enhanced safety through emergency location services</li>
    <li>Integration with various applications and services</li>
    <li>Cost-effective navigation solutions</li>
    <li>Supports outdoor activities like hiking and biking</li>
    <li>Facilitates geocaching and location-based games</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Disadvantages of GPS</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Dependence on technology can lead to reduced map-reading skills</li>
    <li>Privacy concerns with location tracking</li>
    <li>Potential for GPS signal loss in remote areas</li>
    <li>Vulnerability to hacking and spoofing</li>
    <li>Battery drain on devices using GPS</li>
    <li>Inaccuracy in dense urban environments due to signal interference</li>
    <li>Over-reliance can lead to complacency in navigation skills</li>
    <li>Cost of devices and data plans for real-time updates</li>
  </ul>
