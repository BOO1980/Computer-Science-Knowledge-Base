  <h1>1.3 - Participating in a digital world</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>You may already communicate online to some extent in your daily life. And while studying, you'll certainly do
      this as part of the online community of tutors and students.</li>
    <li>When we have a face to face conversation, we don't just rely on the spoken words to establish the other person's
      meaning. Subconsciously, we are also monitoring the tone of their voice, their facial expressions, and their body
      language. </li>
    <li>Telephone conversations are a little bit more ambiguous because we can no longer see that of a person. </li>
    <li>Email and online discussions are harder again, since all we have is text. </li>
    <li>Easy to misinterpret her words on a page, so the writer must take great care before pressing this button that
      sends their message to the world. </li>
    <li>There is a golden rule. A concept common to many ethical codes, which simply states that we should treat
      others as we would want them to treat us. </li>
    <li>This golden rule is relevant to good manners and ethics when talking face to face. So it's relevant to online
      communication. To help apply it, it has been developed into guidelines for online behavior called net etiquette,
      or more commonly, netiquette.</li>
    <li>Netiquette is intended to make us all think about how we behave online, and to make us aware of the affect our
      words could have on others reading them. </li>
    <li>These guidelines aren't hard and fast commands that you must remember and obey. And netiquette does not
      encompass every situation you might find yourself in. </li>
    <li>In fact, it's perfectly possible to obey all the guidance below and still annoy someone. However, netiquette
      provides a good foundation for your participation in online discussions. </li>
    <li>Netika is intended to make us all think about how we behave online, and to make us aware of the effect our words
      could have on others reading them. </li>
    <li>Most of what follows his common sense in good manners</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>1.3.1 - Netiquette: respecting others online</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>As children, we quickly learn many rules about how to interact with other people. Some of these rules are common
      sense, such as don't interrupt a speaker and say please and thank you and are necessary if we are A to reduce the
      likelihood of arguments or causing offense. <ul>
        <li>Fang acknowledge and support people: People can't see you nod, smile or frown as you read their messages. If
          they get no response, they may feel ignored and discouraged from contributing any further. Why not send a
          short reply to keep the conversation going? This can make a big difference in a small group setting such as a
          tutor group forum. </li>
        <li>Acknowledge before differing: Before you disagree with someone, try to summarize the other person's point in
          your own words. Then they know you are trying to understand them, and you will be more likely to take your
          view seriously. Otherwise you risk talking at each other rather than with each other. You should also
          recognize that other people are entitled to their point of view, even if you consider them consider them to be
          entirely wrong. </li>
        <li>Make clear your perspective. Try to speak personally. This means avoiding statements like this is the way it
          is or it is a fact that these sound dogmatic and leave no room for anyone else's perspective. Why not start by
          saying I think or I feel if you are presenting someone else's views then say so, perhaps by using a quotation
          and acknowledgement. </li>
        <li>Other queues: Emotions can be easily misunderstood when you can't see faces or body language. People may not
          realize you are joking and irony and satire easily missed. All good reasons to think before you send a
          message. To compensate for these restrictions, early Internet users came up with the idea of the smiley face,
          which then grew into a whole family of emoticons. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Some digital images, called emojis, are completely used in electronic communications, such as text messages and
      emails, to represent ideas and emotions. Initially, the word emoji comes from the Japanese term for picture
      characters. So although the word is similar to emoticon, this is a coincidence. </li>
    <li>Remember that the systems upon which many forums are based are plain text, so you can't always rely on emojis or
      fonts and colors to add meaning. </li>
    <li>Don't write in capital letters, it would come over as shouting. </li>
    <li>Read something that offends or assets you. It's very tempting to dash off a reply immediately. However, messages
      written in the heat of the moment can often cause offense themselves. </li>
    <li>It is much better. To save your message as a draft and take a break or sleep on it. </li>
    <li>The best advice is to try and be aware of your audience before you post. The Internet is a global phenomenon.
      People from widely different in cultures and backgrounds may read what you write online. And what you find funny
      may be offensive to them. </li>
    <li></li>It may take time to work out what sort of audience can be found in a particular forum. Some are very
    permissive and allow almost any sorts of behavior, while most will not tolerate that behavior or abuse.
