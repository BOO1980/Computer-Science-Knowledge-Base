  <h1>Computers and Communications: from rarity to ubiquity</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>The theme of this section is the development of <strong>digital technologies</strong></strong></li>
    <li>From the physical large and highly expensive equipment of the 1950s to the omnipresent <strong>networks</strong>
      and computer-based devices upon which our digital lives are founded today</li>
    <li>In this section you will compare the development of the computer to the development of the telephone</li>
    <li>Describe some of the digital technologies that form an integral part of many of our lives</li>
    <li>Introduce the term Information Society</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>1.1.1 The Telephone</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>In the 1950s telephones represented the cutting edge of technology</li>
    <li>However, they were not only large and expensive to purchase but also inconvenient to use</li>
    <li>If you wanted to make a call over a distance of more than 15 miles you would had to first call the operator who
      would then make the connection</li>
    <li>Telephones were also expensive to use </li>
    <li>Few people had a home telephone and even fewer made long-distance calls, so most people made use of public
      telephone boxes</li>
    <li>The high cost of using a telephone ensured that anyone who had one tended to use it infrequently, and then only
      for short calls.</li>
    <li>In the 1959, The general Post Office, which ran almost all UK telephone systems at the time, introduced
      subscriber trunk dialling (STD)</li>
    <li>STD allowed users to dial long-distance calls without going through an operator, making it more convenient and
      affordable.</li>
    <li>STD was a major step towards the ubiquity of telephones, as it made long-distance communication more accessible
      to the general public.</li>
    <h2>1.1.2 The Computer</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There were very few computers in the 1950s, and those in existence were treated as objects of wonder with
        almost mythical powers</li>
      <li>Computers were large, expensive, and used primarily for scientific and military purposes</li>
      <li>They were also delicate and consumed a lot of electricty, wasting much of it as heat</li>
      <li>Nowadays however a computer is just another item stocked in supermarkets</li>
      <li>Computers have been incorporated into a kaleidoscopic range of devices that bear no resemblance to what was
        once thought of as a computer</li>
      <li>Powerful computers now sit at the heart of objects as diverse as smartphones and game consoles, cars and
        vacuum cleaners</li>
      <li>It is possible to incorporate computer technologies into almost any object no matter how small, cheap or
        disposable</li>
      <li>These smart devices are "talking to one another", not just within a single room or building, but across the
        globe via the internet using the world wide web</li>
      <li>As the computer vanishes from out of sight it becomes vastly more powerful and ever-present. To use the term
        "ubiquitous computing" is to recognize this shift</li>
      <li>In the smartphone, two previous seperate technologies, computers and the mobile telephone systems have become
        combined in one device</li>
      <li>This convergence of computing and telephone technologies has resulted in new goods and services for people to
        buy and use</li>
      <li>i.e. Many people who were not previously interested in computers are happy to take photographs on their mobile
        phones and share them. In this situation the computer in the phone handles the processing of the photograph and
        enables it to be sent by email or uploaded to social media</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Box 1.1 - The internet and the web</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Although in everyday life people tend to use the terms interchangeably, in reality they are two separate
        (though related) entities</li>
      <li>The Internet is a global network of networks: an internetwork (hence its name)</li>
      <li>The Internet is the infrastructure that connects computers together</li>
      <li>The web (short for world wide web) on the other hand is a service that links files across computers, allowing
        us to access and share information.</li>
      <li>Thus the web is a software system that has been built upon the hardware of the internet</li>
      <li>It is technically incorrect to refer to "searching" or "browsing" the internet. When you carry out an online
        search you are in fact searching the web</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>1.1.3 The networked world</h2>
    <h3>Network and the internet</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>As a result of advances in <strong>Information and communication technology(ICT)</strong> our notions of time
        and location are changing</li>
      <li>Distance is no longer a barrier to commercial or social contact for those of us connected to suitable networks
      </li>
      <li>Some people may find it difficult to imagine not having access to information and services that play a crucial
        role in their daily lives.</li>
      <li>Others may feel that they have no part to play in the digital world because their network access is very
        limited or even non-existent.</li>
      <li>Some simply don’t care about the digital world, viewing it perhaps as a waste of time. </li>
      <li>his computer is part of a complex system consisting of wires and optical fibres, microwaves and lasers,
        switches and satellites, that encompasses almost every part of the world. </li>
      <li>The oceans are wrapped in more than a quarter of a million miles of fibre-optic network cable with several
        strands of glass running through it.</li>
      <li>Each of these strands can carry thousands of simultaneous telephone conversations, a few dozen television
        channels, or any of a range of other forms of digital content (such as web pages).</li>
      <li>This modern communications network enables us to use a mobile phone in the depths of Siberia or take a
        satellite telephone to the Antarctic</li>
      <li>watch television in the middle of the Atlantic, do our banking on the train, or play games with a person on
        the other side of the world.</li>
      <li>It is one of the greatest technological achievements of the last thirty years and it is so reliable, so
        omnipresent, that we very rarely stop to think about what actually happens when we dial a telephone number,
        click on a web link or switch TV channels</li>
      <li>we tend not to think about it until something disrupts the network – whether it be a widespread problem such
        as a power cut, or something more localised such as finding ourselves in a rural area with slow broadband access
        or no mobile phone signal.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Information, knowledge and learning</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The end of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first century are often compared to other
        historical periods of great change, such as the Industrial Revolution, because of the huge technological changes
        that are happening in many areas of our lives</li>
      <li>These developments are taking place in conjunction with correspondingly large social and economic changes,
        often characterised by the terms information society and network society</li>
      <li>Policy makers frequently refer to such terms when driving forward changes in the technological infrastructure.
      </li>
      <li>Politicians often refer to the inevitability of technological change in our information society and stress the
        need to be at the forefront of these changes in order to secure future prosperity</li>
      <li>The development of the broadband network infrastructure, making public services available online, and
        equipping schools and local communities with computers are examples of such changes.</li>
      <li>Another term you might have encountered is that of the knowledge society, which refers to the way that new
        information systems can transform human societies.</li>
      <li>Included in the knowledge society is the idea of the ‘learning society’. The pace of change is so rapid
        nowadays that learning can no longer be confined to our school years and early adulthood.</li>
      <li>Everyone must continue to learn throughout their adult lives in order to benefit from the economic
        opportunities that rapid development makes possible.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Activity 1.3</h4>
    <p>Can you think of an example where changes in technology have resulted in changes to your work, social or family
      life? Have those changes improved your life? Have they created any problems?</p>
    <p>Answer: The use of AI has made so much difference in my work life. Tasks that used to take hours can now be
      completed in minutes, allowing me to focus on more strategic aspects of my job. However, it has also led to
      concerns about job security and the need for continuous learning to keep up with technological advancements.</p>

    <h4>The rise of texting and messaging</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You might wonder about how these technologies change the way we live, work and relax, but sometimes it works
        the other way around.</li>
      <li>Unintended uses sometimes develop alongside the intended uses of emerging technologies in our information
        society.</li>
      <li> A classic example is the text-messaging facility on mobile phones, often referred to as SMS (which stands for
        short message service)</li>
      <li>This was originally a minor feature designed to be used by engineers testing equipment – it was not expected
        to be used by phone owners at all.</li>
      <li>Yet in the first decade of the twenty-first century, SMS messages were one of the most profitable parts of the
        mobile phone business (International Telecommunication Union, 2006).</li>
      <li>SMS resulted in a whole new method of communication and form of popul
      <li>Income from SMS messages peaked at around US$104 billion in 2011 (Associated Press, 2012). </li>
      <li>In more recent times, instant messaging (IM) ‘apps’ used on smartphones, such as WhatsApp, Snapchat and
        Telegram, have overtaken SMS in popularity. By 2015, the IM company WhatsApp was handling 30 billion messages
        every day, compared to the 20 billion SMS messages sent daily (Evans, 2015).</li>
      <li>This difference in usage is partly because there is no extra cost involved in using IM services.</li>
      <li>SMS messages can be expensive on some contracts and require a mobile phone signal, but they are still in use.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS)</strong>: A service that allows for text, audio, and images to be
        sent via the mobile phone signal.</li>
      <h4>Activity 1.4</h4>
      <img src="../../../../../assets/images/tm111 - 1.4 Acitivity.png"
        alt="Weekly use of the internet for instant messaging, by age group: 2005 versus 2014 (Source: Ofcom, 2015)" />
      <ul>
        <li>Study the chart in Figure 1.4. Which age group shows the smallest increase in the percentage of internet
          users who instant messaged between 2005 and 2014? Ages 65+ </li>
        <li>Which age group shows the biggest increase in the percentage of users between 2005 and 2014? Ages 25-34</li>
        <li>Can you offer any explanation for the increase in use amongst all the age groups?
          The rise of smartphones and social media platforms has made instant messaging more accessible and popular
          across all age groups. Many people now use instant messaging for both personal and professional communication,
          leading to a significant increase in usage.</li>
