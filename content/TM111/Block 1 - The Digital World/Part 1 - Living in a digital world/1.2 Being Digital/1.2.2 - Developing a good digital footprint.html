    <h1>1.2.2 - Developing a Good Digital Footprint</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Every time we use social media tools, contribute to blogs or forums, or visit websites, we leave a trail of
            ourselves online.
        </li>
        <li>This activity focuses on your digital footprint - what it is, why it is important, and what you can do to
            make sure it reflects you in a good light.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>What is your digital footprint?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Your digital footprint are the traces you leave behind when you go online</li>
        <li>. It includes everything on the internet about you, for example: <ul>
                <li>Your personal information such as social media profiles from sites such as Facebook, Twitter or
                    LinkedIn.</li>
                <li>Online posts, comments, and interactions.</li>
                <li>Anything that you said online, e.g. contributions on discussion boards or blogs, or articles.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Each time we (or others) add something about ourselves to the internet, we enlarge our digital footprint.
        </li>
        <li>Potential employers or clients may look at your digital footprint when considering you for a job or
            opportunity.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Check your own digital footprint </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Take a moment to think about the places where you are currently active online.</li>
        <li>Also think about what might have been put online in the past, either by you, or by others. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <p>You may have found</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Expected evidence of your activity on Facebook or other social media sites</li>
        <li>Older information that you had forgotten existed. </li>
        <li>Material written about you by other people.</li>
        <li>Photos that you weren't aware of</li>
        <li>Instances of where you have accessed certain websites, for example, when looking at details of job vacancies
            or other people's LinkedIn profiles - many website owners are interested to know who is accessing their
            pages, so it's worth bearing in mind that what you do is not anonymous</li>
        <li>And of course, depending on how common your name is, you will probably find mentions of other people who are
            not you</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why is your digital footprint important?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Your digital footprint can affect your reputation and how others perceive you.</li>
        <li>Employers often check candidates' online presence as part of the hiring process.</li>
        <li>A positive digital footprint can enhance your career prospects and personal brand.</li>
        <li>A negative digital footprint can lead to missed opportunities or damage to your reputation.</li>
        <li>Potential employers are known to look online to find out more about candidates, it is therefore important to
            make a good impression when it comes to getting a job - your digital footprint may be the first thing an
            employer looks at. </li>
        <li>Your digital footprint showcases your skills, professional experience and interests.
    </ul>
    <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Much of the information on the web is public, and you never know who may come across you online</li>
        <li>It is important to remember that what goes online potentially stays online.</li>
        <li>Therefore, it is important to think about what you are happy to present to the world. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to a good digital footprint</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Be mindful of what you post online and how it may be perceived by others.</li>
        <li>Regularly review your privacy settings on social media platforms: Think carefully about who you would like
            to have access to your posts, then check and tighten your privacy settings in all social media sites, e.g.
            Twitter and Facebook. </li>
        <li>Consider the potential long-term impact of your online actions.</li>
        <li>Engage positively with others online and contribute to discussions in a constructive manner.</li>
        <li>De-activate any online profiles you are not using. </li>
        <li>Take down photos that don't show you in the best light (and consider asking others to remove photos you have
            been tagged in). </li>
        <li>Delete posts that you no longer want people to see. Facebook, for example, provides guidance on how to do
            this in its privacy and settings area.</li>
        <li>Consider how your personal views and comments posted online will be read by others. Remember information on
            the internet can be communicated fast and could be difficult to delete or amend. </li>
        <li>Create separate accounts for your personal and professional profiles. </li>
        <li>Think about who is shaping your digital footprint â€“ is it you or your friends?</li>
        <li>Build up a LinkedIn profile to showcase your achievements (e.g. awards, projects or qualifications). </li>
        <li>Be active on Twitter for your profession or field of interest. </li>
        <li>Read and comment on the blogs of experts in your field. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Your digital footprint is the trail of information you leave online.</li>
        <li>It is important to manage your digital footprint to ensure it reflects you positively.</li>
        <li>Regularly review and update your online presence to maintain a good digital footprint.</li>
