    <h1>Activity 1.2 - How digital is your world?</h1>
    <p>Can you think of another technology that has made the transition from novelty to common place?</p>
    <p>Consider how this technology has changed the way you live, work, or communicate. Reflect on its impact on society and whether it has become an essential part of daily life.</p>
    <p>Discuss your thoughts with others or write a short paragraph summarizing your views.</p>
    <h2>Answer</h2>
    <p>One example of a technology that has transitioned from novelty to commonplace is the GPS. Initially, GPS devices were expensive and primarily used by the military. However, with advancements in technology and the integration of GPS into smartphones, it has become an essential tool for navigation in everyday life.</p>
    <p>GPS has transformed how we travel, allowing for real-time navigation, traffic updates, and location sharing. It has also influenced various industries, such as logistics and transportation, by optimizing routes and improving efficiency.</p>
    <p>Overall, GPS has become a ubiquitous technology that enhances convenience and connectivity in our digital world.</p>
