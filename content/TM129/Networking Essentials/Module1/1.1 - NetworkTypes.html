      <h2 id="everything-online">1.1.2 Everything Is Online</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We expect our devices—cell phones, tablets, laptops, and desktop computers—to always be connected to the global Internet.</li>
        <li>We use this network to interact with friends, shop, share pictures and experiences, and learn.</li>
        <li>The Internet has become such a part of everyday life that we almost take it for granted.</li>
        <li>Normally, when people use the term “Internet,” they are not referring to the physical connections in the real world.</li>
        <li>We tend to think of it as a formless collection of connections—the “place” people go to find or share information.</li>

      <h2 id="who-owns">1.1.3 Who Owns the Internet?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No single person, company, or government owns the Internet.</li>
        <li>The Internet is a collection of networks that are all connected to each other, cooperating to exchange information using common standards.</li>
        <li>Through telephone wires, fiber-optic cables, wireless transmissions, and satellite links, Internet users can exchange information in a variety of forms.</li>
        <li>Everything that you access online is located somewhere on the global Internet.</li>
        <li>Social media sites, multiplayer games, email providers, and online courses are all connected to local networks that send and receive information through the Internet.</li>
      </ul>

    <section aria-labelledby="local-networks">
      <h2 id="local-networks">1.1.4 Local Networks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Local networks come in all sizes, from two computers to hundreds of thousands of devices.</li>
        <li>Networks installed in small offices, or homes and home offices, are referred to as small office/home office (SOHO) networks.</li>
        <li>SOHO networks let you share resources—such as printers, documents, pictures, and music—between a few local users.</li>
        <li>In business, large networks can be used to advertise and sell products, order supplies, and communicate with customers.</li>
        <li>Communication over a network is usually more efficient and less expensive than traditional forms, such as regular mail or long-distance phone calls.</li>
        <li>Networks allow rapid communication (email, instant messaging) and provide access to information stored on network servers.</li>
        <li>The Internet is considered a “network of networks” because it is literally made up of thousands of local networks that are connected to each other.</li>
        <li><strong>Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) Networks:</strong> Allow computers in a home office or remote office to connect to a corporate network or access centralized, shared resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Medium to Large Networks:</strong> Used by corporations and schools; can span many locations with hundreds or thousands of interconnected hosts.</li>
        <li><strong>Worldwide Networks:</strong> The Internet is a network of networks that connects hundreds of millions of computers worldwide.</li>
      </ul>

    <section aria-labelledby="mobile-devices">
      <h2 id="mobile-devices">1.1.5 Mobile Devices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Internet connects more than desktop and laptop computers.</li>
        <li>Devices you interact with daily—mobile and home devices—are also connected.</li>
        <li>These include mobile devices, home devices, and a variety of other connected devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Smartphone:</strong> Connects to the Internet from almost anywhere; combines a telephone, camera, GPS receiver, media player, and touch-screen computer.</li>
        <li><strong>Tablet:</strong> Like smartphones, tablets integrate multiple functions. With larger screens, they are ideal for watching videos and reading. On-screen keyboards allow composing emails and browsing the web.</li>
        <li><strong>Smartwatch:</strong> Connects to a smartphone to provide alerts and messages; often includes health features such as heart-rate monitoring and step counting.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Glasses:</strong> Wearable computers (e.g., Google Glass) with a small display that overlays information; touch pads or voice allow navigation while keeping the user’s view unobstructed.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="connected-home">
      <h2 id="connected-home">1.1.6 Connected Home Devices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Many home devices can be connected to the Internet to be monitored and configured remotely.</li>
        <li><strong>Security System:</strong> Items such as security systems, lighting, and climate controls can be monitored and configured remotely using a mobile device.</li>
        <li><strong>Appliances:</strong> Refrigerators, ovens, and dishwashers can be connected for remote power, status monitoring, and alerts (e.g., refrigerator temperature outside acceptable range).</li>
        <li><strong>Smart TV:</strong> Connects to the Internet to access content without a TV service provider; can also browse the web, compose email, or display local media.</li>
        <li><strong>Gaming Console:</strong> Connects to the Internet to download games and play with friends online.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section aria-labelledby="other-devices">
      <h2 id="other-devices">1.1.7 Other Connected Devices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>There are also many connected devices found in the world outside your home that provide convenience and useful, or even vital, information..</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Cars:</strong> Many modern cars can connect to the internet to access maps, audio and video content, or information about a destination. They can even send a text message or email if there is an attempted theft or call for assistance in case of an accident. These cars can also connect to smartphones and tablets to display information about the different engine systems, provide maintenance alerts, or display the status of the security system.</li>
        <li><strong>RFID Tags:</strong> Radio frequency identification (RFIDs) tags can be placed in or on objects to track them or monitor sensors for many conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Sensors and Actuators:</strong> Connected sensors can provide temperature, humidity, wind speed, barometric pressure, and soil moisture data. Actuators can then be automatically triggered based on current conditions. For example, a smart sensor can periodically send soil moisture data to a monitoring station. The monitoring station can then send a signal to an actuator to begin watering. The sensor will continue to send soil moisture data allowing the monitoring station to determine when to deactivate the actuator.</li>
        <li><strong>Medical Devices:</strong> Medical devices such as pacemakers, insulin pumps, and hospital monitors provide users or medical professionals with direct feedback or alerts when vital signs are at specific levels.</li>
