      <ul>
        <li>Mobile devices give us the freedom to work, learn, play, and communicate wherever we want</li>
        <li>People using mobile devices do not need to be tied to a physical location to send and receive voice, video,
          and data communications. In addition, wireless facilities, such as internet cafes, are available in many
          countries</li>
        <li>If the network is secured, you will need to enter the correct password or passphrase to gain access.</li>
        <li>College campuses use wireless networks to allow students to sign up for classes, watch lectures, and submit
          assignments in areas where physical connections to the network are unavailable. </li>
        <li> With mobile devices becoming more powerful, many tasks that needed to be performed on large computers
          connected to physical networks can now be completed using mobile devices on wireless networks.</li>
        <li>lmost all mobile devices are capable of connecting to Wi-Fi networks</li>
        <li>It is advisable to connect to Wi-Fi networks when possible because data used over Wi-Fi does not count
          against the cellular data plan.</li>
        <li>because Wi-Fi radios use less power than cellular radios, connecting to Wi-Fi networks conserves battery
          power</li>
        <li>Like other Wi-Fi-enabled devices, it is important to use security when connecting to Wi-Fi networks.</li>
        <li>These precautions should be taken to protect Wi-Fi communications on mobile devices:
          <ul>
            <li>Never send login or password information using unencrypted text (plaintext).</li>
            <li>Use a VPN connection when possible if you are sending sensitive data.</li>
            <li>Enable security on home networks.</li>
            <li>Use WPA2 or higher encryption for security.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section aria-labelledby="wi-fi settings">
      <h2 id="wi-fi-settings">3.2.2 Wi-Fi Settings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Two of the most popular operating systems for mobile devices are Android and Apple iOS.</li>
        <li>Each operating system has settings that enable you to configure your device to connect to wireless networks.
        </li>
        <li>To connect an Android or iOS device when it is within the coverage range of a Wi-Fi network, turn on Wi-Fi
          and the device then searches for all available Wi-Fi networks and displays them in a list.</li>
        <li>Touch a Wi-Fi network in the list to connect. Enter a password if needed.
        </li>
        <li>When a mobile device is out of the range of the Wi-Fi network, it attempts to connect to another Wi-Fi
          network in range.
        </li>
        <li> If no Wi-Fi networks are in range, the mobile device connects to the cellular data network. When Wi-Fi is
          on, it will automatically connect to any Wi-Fi network that it has connected to previously.</li>
        <li>If the network is new, the mobile device either displays a list of available networks that can be used or
          asks if it should connect to it.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>If your mobile device does not prompt to connect to a Wi-Fi network, the network SSID broadcast may be
          turned off, or the device may not be set to connect automatically.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Manually configure the Wi-Fi settings on the mobile device. </li>
      <li>Remember that SSIDs and passphrases must be typed exactly as entered on the wireless router setup or the
        device will not connect properly, as shown in the figure</li>
      <li>SSID is the name assigned to a wireless network. Passphrase is what we normally use as the “wireless password”
      </li>
      <li>To connect to a Wi-Fi network manually on an Android device, follow these steps:
        <ol>
          <li>Select Settings > Add network.</li>
          <li>Enter the network SSID.</li>
          <li>Touch Security and select a security type.</li>
          <li>Touch Password and enter the password.</li>
          <li>Touch Save.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>To connect to a Wi-Fi network manually on an iOS device, follow these steps:

      <h2 id="configure-cellular-data-settings">3.2.4 Configure Cellular Data Settings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Cellular data plans are offered by most cell phone carriers, but the bandwidth limitations and charges for
          usage vary widely by carrier, and by plan within carriers. </li>
        <li>As a result, many mobile device users only use their cellular data plans when Wi-Fi service is not
          available.</li>
        <li>Android Cellular Data:
          <ul>
            <li>To turn on or off cellular data on an Android device, as shown in the figure, use the following path
            </li>
            <li>Settings > touch More under Wireless and Networks > touch Mobile Networks > touch Data enabled</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>iOS Cellular Data:
          <ul>
            <li>To turn on or off cellular data on an iOS device, use the following path:</li>
            <li>Settings > Cellular Data > turn cellular data on or off</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If no Wi-Fi network is available, the device uses the cellular data capability if it is configured.</li>
        <li>Most of the time, transitions from one network to another are not obvious to the user.</li>
        <li>For example, as a mobile device moves from an area of 4G coverage to 3G coverage, the 4G radio shuts off and
          turns on the 3G radio.</li>
        <li>Connections are not lost during this transition.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Mobile devices connect using many different methods.</li>
        <li>Cellular and Wi-Fi can be difficult to configure, and require extra equipment such as towers and access
          points.</li>
        <li>Cable connections are not always practical when connecting headsets or speakers.</li>
        <li>Bluetooth technology provides a simple way for mobile devices to connect to each other and to wireless
          accessories.</li>
        <li>Bluetooth is wireless, automatic, and uses very little power, which helps conserve battery life. Up to eight
          Bluetooth devices can be connected together at any one time.</li>
        <li>These are some examples of how devices use Bluetooth: <ul>
            <li><strong>Hands-free headset</strong>: A small earpiece with a microphone can be used for making and
              receiving calls.</li>
            <li><strong>Keyboard or mouse</strong>: A keyboard or mouse can be connected to a mobile device to make
              input easier</li>
            <li><strong>Stereo control </strong>: A mobile device can connect to a home or car stereo to play music.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Car speakerphone </strong>: A device that contains a speaker and a microphone can be used for
              making and receiving calls.</li>
            <li><strong>Tethering </strong>: A mobile device can connect to another mobile device or computer to share a
              network connection. Tethering can also be performed with a Wi-Fi connection or a cable connection such as
              USB.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile speaker </strong>: Portable speakers can connect to mobile devices to provide
              high-quality audio without a stereo system.</li>
          </ul>

    <section aria-labelledby="bluetooth-pairing">
      <h2 id="bluetooth-pairing">3.2.7 Bluetooth Pairing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Bluetooth pairing occurs when two Bluetooth devices establish a connection to share resources.</li>
        <li>In order for the devices to pair, the Bluetooth radios are turned on, and one device begins searching for
          other devices.</li>
        <li>Other devices must be set to discoverable mode, also called visible, so that they can be detected.</li>
        <li>When a Bluetooth device is in discoverable mode, it transmits the following information when another
          Bluetooth device requests it:<ul>
            <li>Device name</li>
            <li>Bluetooth Class</li>
            <li>Services that the device can use
            </li>
            <li>Technical information, such as the features or the Bluetooth specification that it supports</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>During the pairing process, a personal identification number (PIN) may be requested to authenticate the
          pairing process.
        <li>The PIN is often a number, but can also be a numeric code or passkey. </li>
        <li>The PIN is stored using pairing services, so it does not have to be entered the next time the device tries
          to connect.</li>
        <li>convenient when using a headset with a smart phone, because they are paired automatically when the headset
          is turned on and within range</li>
        <li>To pair a Bluetooth device with an Android device, follow these steps: <ol>
            <li>Follow the instructions for your device to place it in discoverable mode.</li>
