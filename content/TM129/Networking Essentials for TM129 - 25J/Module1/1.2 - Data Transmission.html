            <ul>
                <li>You hear about data all the time, especially when we talk about computer networks
                    <ul>
                        <li>You hear about data that's transmitted</li>
                        <li>You hear about data that's been stored</li>
                        <li>You hear about big data</li>
                        <li>You hear about data that exists on the cloud</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Volunteer data is data that you offer yourself, the data is being collected about you and you are
                    agreeing to share it, or store it somewhere on the network.</li>
                <li>Inferred data is data that is generated by analyzing your behavior, preferences, and interactions,
                    often without your explicit consent.</li>
                <li>An example of inferred data is your credit card, every place you use your credit card generates data
                    about your spending habits and preferences.</li>
                <li>Credit card use can pinpoint your location, and this information becomes part of a larger databank
                    that is stored within bank systems.</li>
                <li>Another type of data is observed data, ie. your phone probably keeps track of your location, most
                    people have location services on.</li>
                <li>This is why we need to be careful sometimes when we click "I agree" on those terms and conditions.

            <ul>
                <li>computers and networks only work with binary digits, zeros and ones</li>
                <li>Each bit can only have one of two possible values, 0 or 1</li>
                <li>The term bit is an abbreviation of “binary digit” and represents the smallest piece of data</li>
                <li>Humans interpret words and pictures, computers interpret only patterns of bits.</li>
                <li>A bit is stored and transmitted as one of two possible discrete states.</li>
                <li>his can include two directions of magnetization, two distinct voltage or current levels, two
                    distinct levels of light intensity, or any other physical system of two discrete states</li>
                <li>For example, a light switch can be either On or Off; in binary representation, these states would
                    correspond to 1 and 0 respectively</li>
                <li>Every input device (mouse, keyboard, voice-activated receiver) will translate human interaction into
                    binary code for the CPU to process and store</li>
                <li>Every output device (printer, speakers, monitors, etc.) will take binary data and translate it back
                    into human recognizable form</li>
                <li>Within the computer itself, all data is processed and stored as binary</li>
                <li>Computers use binary codes to represent and interpret letters, numbers and special characters with
                    bits.</li>
                <li>A commonly used code is the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)</li>
                <li>With ASCII, each character is represented by eight bits. For example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Capital letter: A = 01000001</li>
                        <li>Number: 9 = 00111001</li>
                        <li>Special character: # = 00100011</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Each group of eight bits, such as the representations of letters and numbers, is known as a byte.
                <li>Codes can be used to represent almost any type of information digitally including computer data,
                    graphics, photos, voice, video, and music.

                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>After the data is transformed into a series of bits, it must be converted into signals that can be
                    sent across the network media to its destination</li>
                <li>Media refers to the physical medium on which the signals are transmitted</li>
                <li>Examples of media are copper wire, fiber-optic cable, and electromagnetic waves through the air</li>
                <li>A signal consists of electrical or optical patterns that are transmitted from one connected device
                    to another</li>
                <li>These patterns represent the digital bits (i.e. the data) and travel across the media from source to
                    destination as either a series of pulses of electricity, pulses of light, or radio waves</li>
                <li>Signals may be converted many times before ultimately reaching the destination, as corresponding
                    media changes between source and destination.</li>
                <li>There are three common methods of signal transmission used in networks:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Electrical Signals: Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on
                            copper wire. </li>
                        <li>Optical Signals: Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into light
                            pulses</li>
                        <li>Wireless Signals: Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves
                            through the air.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>In most homes and small businesses, network signals are transmitted across copper wires (cables) or
                    Wi-Fi enabled wireless connections.</li>
                <li>Larger networks employ fiber-optic cables in order to reliably carry signals for longer distances.
                </li>
