          afternoon. Hey, you have one minute and 50 seconds left on your 15 minute timer. Phone. I. 4. Alexa, what's
          the time? It's 2:08 PM. Superheroes. Thank you. Obviously. You have to forget about. House first you try
          acting like that doesn't work. Reservation for 7. 24 hours ago. Nothing. Bobby, I like Sir put 15 minute timer
          out. You've had an erection for three hours. Barclay It was just embarrassing and I was really starting to
          hurt the antibiotics. Barclay. You missed the shot. Doesn't require ball dedicated to the Holy Trinity. Heart,
          hands, hoes could be the emerald conduction. Alexa, how long is left on my timer? Alexa put a 15 minute timer
          on 15 minutes, starting now. It is possible for brain tumor. Hey, Cortana voice. I have no idea. Hey, Cortana.
          Call another doctor. Lots of other doctors. Post my sisters on the Internet You guys are over. Two back up. By
          $395 OK, that guy's an idiot. That doesn't mean neither one of you have privileges at this hospital. Please
          leave. Now, I'm sorry for the intrusion, but I understand that I had MRI seriously. I'm pretty sure he's got a
          brain too. We consider that concluded from cytosis, more likely starting in what hydroxyapatite is. Platelets
          don't seem anywhere if you took an image, I'm sure no signs of increase. I seep I'm not doing. Back to bosses
          boyfriend. I want an MRI. Great, you're up. Stop. * News. Good choice. So, so good. Hey, Cortana. Pull up. I
          went crazy. I leave for embraces in a Bugatti. Everybody will not be on hatching. Codependent solver. Hey,
          Cortana online. You know Foreman. You know the situation. How can I get him to tell Mcdowell? He's the one
          who's afraid of failure. For me, he's ever done justified. In control of my work at home, it's not as possible
          to do his job. You're saying this is all my fault? Say. Hey Cortana, what's the worst challenging games on the
          job? Which doesn't so? Say this is loud. Yeah. Shut up. If nothing in the world can hold your efforts. God,
          you are spending more class because I didn't think big enough. Now open a $25,000 more. Hey Cortana is the
          wisdom of crowds. To show the collective decision of a group can be more accurate than an individual's
          decision. To my emails if you. Had amoledosis speckled? 100% of cases. Coming up Tuesdays, she was busy. Hey,
          Cortana. I. This may not be the best time for this. I love you to keep the department open so you can keep
          your job. Watch Does It Really Matter How It Happened? I broke my toilet. Urine was clean for Vicodin. It did
          however, contain strange epithelial cells. Further analysis showed they were from elaborate over treatment.
          Alexa, Alex, what's the time? It's 2:34 PM. We know you're back on Viking, no? You know how I did it? Or, more
          interesting, where I be? House, you spend the last three months at 2:00. Why is your life better? Oh, it
          hurts. It's going out. You really think I'm using it? You're an addict. You can't be surprised if you can't
          take your work. This is some proof. Youtube. Explain why overwhelming desire? Makes them build up in your
          organs, choke your nerves, keep your fingers from growing water. It's chronic, but manageable. But it wasn't.

          says the guy making sandcastle to my bright We need to keep your careers and taking a job away, the medical
          puzzles you back to. Maybe diagnostic medicine is the. Is it OK with me going online solving cases? The only
          thing works for you than going back to diagnostic medicines. If your son was a student at one of the greatest
          universities in the world, so he can come to you. Once you cross 40 seconds, always I appreciate your call,
          but as always you have brought much of it. Setting up this place top of 13. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. It's
          getting worse. Obama is a guest of the US government, and he's been invited to speak. Not asking 11. I'm
          asking you to do your job. Hey, Cortana. Stop. Listening, I know how this looks. I know it might break this
          up. That's better than definite break this up, which is what would have happened. Oh my God, three years ago.
          So crazy. You're back. You look good when you tell me how to set up this Friday, 13, 35 longer. Was an
          assassination. Attention William Russian Diamond FBI checked the service process forms and his hotel. No
          radio. Is a boatman sentence Larry's end of this country list on 1/4? Sorry, if you wanna explain 13, it's not
          ready. He doesn't have his license, then he can't practice. But we'd be idiots not to listen to him. You're in
          charge. He sits in on all the directions. To get your people up this week. But he takes teenage boys from the
          provinces and feeds them drugs and alcohol. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. I'm very sorry, but I can't discuss
          other patients. You should talk to a lawyer. Talk to the UN. Yes, choose. Start complaining about the extra
          noise and the cooking smells making things worse. It's on the condo board. I'm trying to get the back
          gardener. Sure. from the server. </li>
        <li>Email: The email server runs email server software. Clients use mail client software such as Microsoft
          Office to access email on the server. </li>
        <li>Web: The web server runs web server software. Clients use browser software such as Windows Internet Explorer
          to access web pages on the server. </li>
        <li>File: The file server stores corporate and user files in central location. The client devices access these
          files with client software such as the Windows File Explorer. </li>

      <h2 id="peer-to-peer-networks">2.1.3 Peer-to-Peer Networks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Local networks come in all sizes, from two computers to hundreds of thousands of devices.</li>
        <li>Networks installed in small offices, or homes and home offices, are referred to as small office/home office
          (SOHO) networks.</li>
        <li>SOHO networks let you share resources—such as printers, documents, pictures, and music—between a few local
          users.</li>
        <li>In business, large networks can be used to advertise and sell products, order supplies, and communicate with
          customers.</li>
        <li>Communication over a network is usually more efficient and less expensive than traditional forms, such as
          regular mail or long-distance phone calls.</li>
        <li>Networks allow rapid communication (email, instant messaging) and provide access to information stored on
          network servers.</li>
        <li>The Internet is considered a “network of networks” because it is literally made up of thousands of local
          networks that are connected to each other.</li>
        <li><strong>Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) Networks:</strong> Allow computers in a home office or remote office
          to connect to a corporate network or access centralized, shared resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Medium to Large Networks:</strong> Used by corporations and schools; can span many locations with
          hundreds or thousands of interconnected hosts.</li>
        <li><strong>Worldwide Networks:</strong> The Internet is a network of networks that connects hundreds of
          millions of computers worldwide.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="mobile-devices">1.1.5 Mobile Devices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Internet connects more than desktop and laptop computers.</li>
        <li>Devices you interact with daily—mobile and home devices—are also connected.</li>
        <li>These include mobile devices, home devices, and a variety of other connected devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Smartphone:</strong> Connects to the Internet from almost anywhere; combines a telephone, camera,
          GPS receiver, media player, and touch-screen computer.</li>
        <li><strong>Tablet:</strong> Like smartphones, tablets integrate multiple functions. With larger screens, they
          are ideal for watching videos and reading. On-screen keyboards allow composing emails and browsing the web.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Smartwatch:</strong> Connects to a smartphone to provide alerts and messages; often includes health
          features such as heart-rate monitoring and step counting.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Glasses:</strong> Wearable computers (e.g., Google Glass) with a small display that overlays
          information; touch pads or voice allow navigation while keeping the user’s view unobstructed.</li>
      </ul>

    <section aria-labelledby="connected-home">
      <h2 id="connected-home">1.1.6 Connected Home Devices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Many home devices can be connected to the Internet to be monitored and configured remotely.</li>
        <li><strong>Security System:</strong> Items such as security systems, lighting, and climate controls can be
          monitored and configured remotely using a mobile device.</li>
        <li><strong>Appliances:</strong> Refrigerators, ovens, and dishwashers can be connected for remote power, status
          monitoring, and alerts (e.g., refrigerator temperature outside acceptable range).</li>
        <li><strong>Smart TV:</strong> Connects to the Internet to access content without a TV service provider; can
          also browse the web, compose email, or display local media.</li>
        <li><strong>Gaming Console:</strong> Connects to the Internet to download games and play with friends online.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section aria-labelledby="other-devices">
      <h2 id="other-devices">1.1.7 Other Connected Devices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>There are also many connected devices found in the world outside your home that provide convenience and
          useful, or even vital, information..</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Cars:</strong> Many modern cars can connect to the internet to access maps, audio and video
          content, or information about a destination. They can even send a text message or email if there is an
          attempted theft or call for assistance in case of an accident. These cars can also connect to smartphones and
          tablets to display information about the different engine systems, provide maintenance alerts, or display the
          status of the security system.</li>
        <li><strong>RFID Tags:</strong> Radio frequency identification (RFIDs) tags can be placed in or on objects to
          track them or monitor sensors for many conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Sensors and Actuators:</strong> Connected sensors can provide temperature, humidity, wind speed,
          barometric pressure, and soil moisture data. Actuators can then be automatically triggered based on current
          conditions. For example, a smart sensor can periodically send soil moisture data to a monitoring station. The
          monitoring station can then send a signal to an actuator to begin watering. The sensor will continue to send
          soil moisture data allowing the monitoring station to determine when to deactivate the actuator.</li>
        <li><strong>Medical Devices:</strong> Medical devices such as pacemakers, insulin pumps, and hospital monitors
          provide users or medical professionals with direct feedback or alerts when vital signs are at specific levels.
