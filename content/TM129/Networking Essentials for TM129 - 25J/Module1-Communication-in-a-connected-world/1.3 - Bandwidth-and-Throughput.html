    <h1>1.3 Bandwidth and Throughput</h1>
    <h2>1.3.1 Bandwith</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Streaming a movie or playing a multiplayer game requires realiablem, fast connections</li>
        <li>To support high Bandwidth applications, networks have to be capable of transmitting and recieving bits at a
            very high rate</li>
        <li>Different physcial media support the transfer of bits a different speeds</li>
        <li>The rate of data transfer is usually discussed in terms of bandwidth and Throughput</li></i>
        <li>Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data</li>
        <li>Digital Bandwidth measures the amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of
            time</li>
        <li>Bandwidth is typically measured in the number of bits that (theoretically) can be sent across the media in a
            second</li>
        <li>Common bandwith measurments are as follows <ul>
                <li>Thousands of bits per second</li>
                <li>Millions of bits per second</li>
                <li>Billions of bits per second</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Physical media properties, current technologies and the laws of physics all play a role in determining
            available bandwidth</li>

    </ul>
    <li>The following shows the commonly used units of measure for bandwidth:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>bps (bits per second) - 1bps = fundamental unit of data transfer</li>
        <li>Kbps (kilobits per second) - 1 Kbps = 1,000 bps = 10^3 bps</li>
        <li>Mbps (megabits per second) - 1 Mbps = 1,000,000 bps = 10^6 bps</li>
        <li>Gbps (gigabits per second) - 1 Gbps = 1,000,000,000 bps = 10^9 bps</li>
        <li>Tbps (terabits per second) - 1 Tbps = 1,000,000,000,000 bps = 10^12 bps</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>1.3.2 Throughput</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Like bandwidth, throughput is the measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of
            time</li>
        <li>However, due to a number of factors, throughput does not usually match the specified bandwidth</li>
        <li>Many factors influence throughput including:<ul>
                <li>The amount of data being sent and received over the connection</li>
                <li>The types of data being transmitted</li>
                <li>The latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Latency refers to the amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another.
        </li>
        <li>Throughput measurements do not take into account the validity or usefulness of the bits being transmitted
            and received</li>
        <li>Many messages received through the network are not destined for specific user applications</li>
        <li>An example would be network control messages that regulate traffic and correct errors.</li>
        <li>In an internetwork or network with multiple segments, throughput cannot be faster than the slowest link of
            the path from sending device to the receiving device</li>
        <li>Even if all or most of the segments have high bandwidth, it will only take one segment in the path with
            lower bandwidth to create a slowdown of the throughput of the entire network.</li>
        <li>There are many online speed tests that can reveal the throughput of an internet connection.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>1.3.3 Video - Throughput</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Throughput is the amount of data sent and recieved over a connection, including the delays that might occur
        </li>
        <li>This includes delays in both directions
    </ul>
