      <ul>
        <li>Our cellphones communicate on many different networks. </li>
        <li>When we're communicating over the voice channel and we're talking, say to someone another cell phone, our
          communications are going through the cellular provider network. </li>
        <li>When we use a Bluetooth device like a speaker or a headset or even a smartwatch, that device is
          communicating through a completely different network. It is a much shorter range wireless network than the
          cellular network and it works with different rules and different protocols. </li>
        <li>Wi Fi is something you are probably the most familiar because Wi-fi is supported on many different types of
          devices, including smartphones. </li>
        <li>When we are working on a Wi Fi network, we are usually using that network to communicate over the global
          Internet. </li>
        <li>We also have near field communications allowing us to send information over an extremely short distance.
        </li>
        <li>This is how we might use the smartphone to pay for something in a grocery store. </li>
        <li>All these communications protocols, rules and frequencies are contained within the same device. </li>
        <li>Your cellphone is also capable of receiving GPS signals. Meaning that your cellphone is actually receiving
          signals from satellites at our stations all around the earth. </li>
        <li>In summary, our mobile devices are equipped to communicate over a variety of wireless networks, each with
          its own unique characteristics and protocols.</li>Phone.

        Networks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Smartphones have multiple radios, transmitters and receivers to do the talking. </li>
        <li>These components work together to enable communication over various wireless networks.</li>
        <li>We also have Wi-fi. We use hotspots and usually we also have a home wireless network. </li>
        <li>Most of us use our cell phones of a way to get to places. We use the location services including our GPS,
          maps and places near me. </li>
        <li>We also use our cellphone to pay for services or items. we can take our cellphone next to the cash register
          or the receiver and automatically have our financial information transferred. </li>

      <ul>

        <li>In addition to the GSM and 4G5G transmitters and receivers, smartphones make connection in a variety of
          ways. </li>
        <li>Global Positioning System: The GPS uses satellites to transmit signals that cover the globe. The smartphone
          can receive these signals and calculate the phone's location to an accuracy of within 10 meters. </li>
        <li>Wi fi: <ul>
            <li>
              Wi Fi transmitters and receivers located within the smartphone enables a phone to connect to local
              networks and Internet.</li>
            <li>In order to receive and send data on the Wi Fi network, the phone needs to be within the range of the
              signal from a wireless network access point.</li>
            <li>Wi Fi networks are usually privately owned, but often provide guest or public access hotpots.</li>
            <li>A hotspot is an area where Wi Fi signals are available.</li>
            <li>Wi Fi networks connection on the phone and similar to the network connections on a laptop computer.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Bluetooth:<ul>
            <li>Bluetooth is a low power, short range wireless technology that is intended to replace wired connectivity
              for accessories such as speakers, headphones and microphones. </li>
            <li>Bluetooth can also be used to connect a smart watch to a smartphone. </li>
            <li>Bluetooth technology can be used to transmit both data and voice. It can be used to create small local
              networks. </li>
            <li>Bluetooth is wireless technology allows devices to communicate over short distances. </li>
            <li>Multiple devices can be connected at the same time with Bluetooth. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Near Field Communication (NFC):
          <ul>
            <li>
              NFC is a wireless communication technology that enables data to be exchanged by devices that are in a very
              close proximity to each other. Usually less than a few CM.
            </li>
            <li>For example, NFC can be used to connect a smartphone and a payment system. </li>
            <li>NFC uses electromagnetic fields to transmit data. </li>

      <ul>
        <li>A P2P application allows a device to act as both a client and a server within the same communication. </li>
        <li>In this model, every client is the server and every server is a client.</li>
        <li>P2P applications require that each end device provider user interface and run a background service. </li>
        <li>Applications use a hybrid system where resource sharing is decentralized, but the indexes that point to
          resource locations are stored in a centralized directory. </li>
        <li>In a hybrid system, each peer accesses an index server to get the location of a resource stored on another
          peer. </li>
