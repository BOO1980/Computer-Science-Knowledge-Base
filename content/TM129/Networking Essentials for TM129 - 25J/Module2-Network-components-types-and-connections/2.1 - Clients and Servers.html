      <ul>
        <li>In modern networks, computer hosts can act as a client, a server, or both.</li>
        <li>The software installed on the computer determines which role the computer plays</li>
        <li>Servers are hosts that have software installed which enables them to provide information to other hosts on
          the network like email or webpages</li>
        <li>Each server service requires a separate server software</li>
        <li>Clients are computer hosts that have software installed that enables the host to request and display the
          information obtained from the server</li>
        <li>An example of client software is a web browser such as Chrome, Edge, Safari or Firefox</li>
        <li>Using web browser software the client can request the webpage from the server and the web server will
          respond with the webpage</li>
        <li>Another example of client software is email client software, which allows users to send and receive email
          messages</li>

      <ul>
        <li>All computers connected to a network that participate directly in network communication are classified as
          hosts.</li>
        <li>Hosts can send and receive messages on the network</li>
        <li>In modern networks, computer hosts can act as a client, a server, or both</li>
        <li>The software installed on the computer determines which role the computer plays.</li>
        <li>Servers are hosts that have software installed which enables them to provide information, like email or
          webpages, to other hosts on the network</li>
        <li>Each server service requires a separate server software</li>
        <li>Every destination that you visit online is provided to you but a server located somewhere on a network that
          is connected to the global internet</li>
        <li>Clients are computer host that have software installed that enables the host to request and display the
          information obtained from the server. </li>
        <li>Email: The email server runs email server software. Clients use mail client software such as Microsoft
          Office to access email on the server. </li>
        <li>Web: The web server runs web server software. Clients use browser software such as Windows Internet Explorer
          to access web pages on the server. </li>
        <li>File: The file server stores corporate and user files in central location. The client devices access these
          files with client software such as the Windows File Explorer. </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="peer-to-peer-networks">2.1.3 Peer-to-Peer Networks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Client/server software usually run on separate computers, but it is also possible for one computer to run
          both client and server software at the same time. </li>
        <li>In small businesses and homes, many computers function as the server and clients on the network. </li>
        <li>This type of network is called peer to peer (P2P) network. </li>
        <li>The simplest P2P network consists of two directly connected computers using either a wired or wireless
          connection. </li>
        <li>Multiple PCs can also be connected to create a larger P2P network, but this requires a network device such
          as a
          switch to interconnect the computers. </li>
        <li>The main disadvantage of a P2P environment is that the performance of a host can be slowed down if it is
          acting as both a client and a server at the same time. </li>
        <li>In large businesses, because of the potential for high amounts of network traffic, it is often necessary to
          have dedicated servers to support the number of service requests. </li>
        <li>Advantages<ul>
            <li>Easy to set up. </li>
            <li>Less complex. </li>
            <li>Lower cost because network devices and dedicated servers may not be required. </li>
            <li>Can be used for simple tests such as transferring files and sharing printers. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Disadvantages. <ul>
            <li>No centralized administration. </li>
            <li>Not as secure. </li>
            <li>Not scalable.</li>
            <li>All devices may act as both clients and service, which can slow their performance.
          </ul>

    <section aria-labelledby="peer-to-peer-applications">
      <h2 id="peer-to-peer-applications">2.1.4 Peer-to-peer applications. </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A P2P application allows a device to act as both a client and a server within the same communication. </li>
        <li>In this model, every client is the server and every server is a client.</li>
        <li>P2P applications require that each end device provider user interface and run a background service. </li>
        <li>Applications use a hybrid system where resource sharing is decentralized, but the indexes that point to
          resource locations are stored in a centralized directory. </li>
        <li>In a hybrid system, each peer accesses an index server to get the location of a resource stored on another
          peer. </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="multiplie-roles-in-network">2.1.5 Multiple roles in the network. </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A computer with server software can provide services simultaneously to one or more many clients</li>
        <li>Additionally, a single computer can run multiple types of server software. </li>
        <li>In our home or small business, it may be necessary for one computer to act as a file server, a web server,
          and an email server.</li>
        <li>A single computer can also run multiple types of client software. </li>
        <li>There must be client software for every service required. </li>
        <li>With multiple clients installed, a host can connect to multiple servers at the same time. </li>
