      <ul>
        <li>Most home networks consist of at least two separate networks</li>
        <li>The first network is the public network that is coming in from the service provider, usually a cable or DSL
          connection.</li>
        <li>The DSL provider or cable provider network does not use the same protocols and transmission methods as does
          an ethernet network</li>
        <li>So one thing you are going to see in almost every home network is a modem</li>
        <li>The modem converts the signals coming from the provider network</li>
        <li>The modem has an input for the Coaxial cable and it also has an output port that goes to the local network
        </li>
        <li>Almost all home networking devices provide wireless connectivity</li>
        <li>Modems will have internet port and LAN connectivity ports, these ports are usually switched ports</li>
        <li>LAN ports are used to connect devices within the local network</li>
        <li>WAN ports are used to connect to the internet</li>
        <li>Most modems have built in wireless access point called a Router</li>
        <li>The reason why they are called routers is that the ports are separated into two separate networks</li>
        <li>The first network is called the local network, which can be wired (plug into an Ethernet port) or wireless
          (connect via Wi-Fi).</li>
        <li>The second network is the wide area network (WAN), which connects to the internet.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>Below.
        <li>Smartphones have multiple radios, transmitters and receivers to do the talking.In addition to an integrated
          router, there are many different types of devices that might be connecting to a home network :
          <ul>
            <li>Desktop computers. </li>
            <li>Gaming systems. </li>
            <li>Smart TV systems.</li>
            <li>Printers. </li>
            <li>Scanners. </li>
            <li>Security cameras. </li>
            <li>climate control devices. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>As the new technologies come on to market, more and more household functions will rely on the network to
          provide connectivity and control. </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="typical-home-network-routers">4.1.3 - Typical Home Network Routers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Small business and home routers typically have two primary types of ports. <ul>
            <li>Ethernet Ports: These ports connect to the internal switch portion of the router.
              These ports are usually labeled Ethernet or LAN. All devices connected to the switch ports are on the same
              local network. </li>
            <li>Internet Port: This port is used to connect the device to another network. The Internet port connects
              the router to a different network than the if a net ports. The port is often used to connect to the cable
              or DSL modem in order to access the Internet. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>In addition to the wired ports, many home routers include a radio antenna and a built in wireless access
          point. </li>
        <li>By default, the wireless devices are on the same local network as the devices that are physically plugged
          into the LAN switch ports. </li>
        <li>The Internet port is the only port that is on a different network in the default configuration. </li>
      </ul>
