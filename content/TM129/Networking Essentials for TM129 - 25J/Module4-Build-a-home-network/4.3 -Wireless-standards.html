        <ul>
            <li>A number of standards have been developed to ensure that wireless devices can communicate. </li>

            <li>They specify the RF spectrum used, data rates, how the information is transmitted and more. </li>
            <li>The main organization responsible for the creation of wireless technical standards is the Institute of
                Electrical and Electronics Engineers. (IEEE)</li>
            <li>The IEEE 802.11 Standard governs the WLAN environment. </li>
            <li>There are amendments to the IEEE 80211 standards that describe characteristics for different standards
                of wireless communications. </li>
            <li>Wireless standards for LANs use the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands. </li>
            <li>Collectively, these technologies are referred to as Wi-Fi.</li>
            <li>Another organization, known as the Wi-Fi Alliance is responsible for testing wireless LAN devices from
                different manufacturers. </li>
            <li>The Wi Fi logo on the device means that this equipment meets standards and should operate with other
                devices that use the same standard. </li>
            <li>While the standards are constantly improving the connectivity and speed of Wi Fi networks. </li>
            <li>It is important to be aware of new standards as they are introduced, because manufacturers of wireless
                devices will implement these standards quickly in their new products. </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Wireless routers using the 802.11 standards have multiple settings that have to be configured. These
                settings include the following. <ul>
                    <li>Network mode: Determines the type of technology. That must be supported. For example 802.11 B.
                        802.11 G. 802.11 N. Or mixed mode. </li>
                    <li>Network Name (SSID):Used to identify WLAN. Or devices that wish to participate in WLAN must have
                        the same SSID.

                    </li>

                    <li>Standard channel: Specifies the channel over which communication will occur. By default it's set
                        to To
                        auto to allow the access point. (AP)To determine the optimum channel to use. </li>
                    <li>SSID broadcast: Determines if the SSID will be broadcast or devices within range. By default set
                        to
                        enabled. Note: SSID stands for Service Set Identifier. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The 802.11 protocol can provide increased throughput based on the wireless network environment. </li>
            <li>If all wireless devices connect with the same 802.11 standard, maximum speeds can be obtained for that
                standard. </li>
            <li>If the access point is configured to accept only 1802.11 standard, devices that do not use that standard
                cannot connect to the access point. </li>
            <li>A mixed mode wireless network environment can include devices that use any of the existing Wi Fi
                standards. </li>
            <li>The environment provides easy access for older devices that need a wireless connection, but does not
                support the latest standards. </li>
            <li>When building a wireless network, it's important that the wireless components connect to the appropriate
                WLAN. This is done using the SSID. </li>
            <li>The SSID is a case sensitive alphanumeric string that contains up to 32 characters. </li>
            <li>The SSID is sent in the header of all frames transmitted over the WLAN. </li>
            <li>The SSID broadcast allows other devices and wireless clients to automatically discover the name of the
                wireless network. </li>
            <li>When the SSID broadcast is disabled, you must manually enter the SSID on the wireless devices. </li>
            <li>Disabling SSID broadcasting can make it more difficult for legitimate clients to find the wireless
                network. </li>
            <li>However, simply turning off the SSID broadcast is not sufficient to prevent an authorized clients from
                connecting to the wireless network. </li>
            <li>Or, whilst that works, should use the strongest available encryption to restrict the unauthorized
                access. </li>
            </l>
