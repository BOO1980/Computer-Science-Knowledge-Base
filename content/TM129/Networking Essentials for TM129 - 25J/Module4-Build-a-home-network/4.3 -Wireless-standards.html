    <h1>4.3 Wireless Standards</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>A number of standards have been developed to ensure that wireless devices can communicate. </li>

            <li>They specify the RF spectrum used, data rates, how the information is transmitted and more. </li>
            <li>The main organization responsible for the creation of wireless technical standards is the Institute of
                Electrical and Electronics Engineers. (IEEE)</li>
            <li>The IEEE 802.11 Standard governs the WLAN environment. </li>
            <li>There are amendments to the IEEE 80211 standards that describe characteristics for different standards
                of wireless communications. </li>
            <li>Wireless standards for LANs use the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands. </li>
            <li>Collectively, these technologies are referred to as Wi-Fi.</li>
            <li>Another organization, known as the Wi-Fi Alliance is responsible for testing wireless LAN devices from
                different manufacturers. </li>
            <li>The Wi Fi logo on the device means that this equipment meets standards and should operate with other
                devices that use the same standard. </li>
            <li>While the standards are constantly improving the connectivity and speed of Wi Fi networks. </li>
            <li>It is important to be aware of new standards as they are introduced, because manufacturers of wireless
                devices will implement these standards quickly in their new products. </li>
        </ul>
