        <ul>
            <li>The wireless technology's most frequent used in home networks are in the on license 2.4 GHZ and 5 GHZ
                frequency ranges. </li>
            <li>Bluetooth is a technology that makes use of the 2.4 GHZ band. </li>
            <li>It is limited to low speed, short range communications, but has the advantage of communicating with many
                devices at the same time. </li>
            <li>This one to many communication has made Bluetooth technology the preferred method for connecting
                computer peripherals such as wireless mice, keyboards and printers. </li>
            <li>Bluetooth is a good method for transmitting audio to speakers or headphones. </li>
            <li>Other technologies that use the 2.4 GHZ and 5 GHZ bands are the modern wireless LAN technologies that
                conform to the various IEEE, 802.11 standards. </li>
            <li>Unlike Bluetooth technology, 802.11 devices transmit at a much higher power level. Giving them a great
                range and improved throughput. </li>
            <li>Certain areas of the electromagnetic spectrum can be used without a permit. </li>
            <li>These include the 2.4 GHZ and 5 GHZ bands used by Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Although many home network devices support wireless communications, there are still a few applications
                where devices benefit from a wired switch connection that is not shared with other users on the network.
            </li>
            <li>The most commonly implemented wire protocol is the Ethernet protocol. </li>
            <li>Ethernet uses a suite of protocols that allow network devices to communicate over a wired LAN
                connection. </li>
            <li>An Ethernet LAN can connect devices using many different types of wiring media. </li>
            <li>Directly connected devices use an Ethernet patch cable, usually unshielded twisted pair. </li>
            <li>These cables can be purchased with the RJ 45 connectors already installed and they come in various
                lengths. </li>
            <li>Recently constructed homes may have Ethernet jacks already wired in the wall of the home. For those
                homes that do not have UTP wiring, there are other technologies such as a power line that can distribute
                wide connectivity throughout the premises. </li>
            <li>Cable types: <ul>
                    <li>Category 5 E Cable: Category 5E is the most common wiring used in a LAN. The cable is made up of
                        4 pairs of wires that are twisted to reduce electrical interference. </li>
                    <li>Coaxial cable: Coaxial cable has an inner wire surrounded by a tubular insulating layer. That is
                        then Surrounded by a tubular conducting shield, Most coax cables. Also have an external
                        insulating sheath or jacket. </li>
                    <li>Fiber optic cable: Fiber optic cables can be either glass or plastic with a diameter about the
                        same as a human hair, and it can carry digital information at very high speeds over long
                        distances. </li>
                    <li>Fiber optic cables have a very high bandwidth which enables them to carry very large amounts of
                        data. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
