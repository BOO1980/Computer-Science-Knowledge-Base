        <ul>
            <li>Many wireless routers designed for home use have an automatic setup utility that can be used to
                configure the basic settings on the router. </li>
            <li>These utilities usually require PC or laptop to be connected to a wired port on the router. </li>
            <li>If no device is available that has a wide connection, it may be necessary to configure the wireless
                client software on the laptop or tablet first. </li>
            <li>To connect to the router using a wired connection, plug an ethernet patch cable into the network port on
                the computer. </li>
            <li>Plug the other end into a LAN port on the router. </li>
            <li>Do not plug the cable into the portal interface that is labeled Internet. </li>
            <li>The Internet port will connect to the DSL or cable modem. </li>
            <li>Some home routers may have a built in modem for Internet connections. </li>
            <li>If this is the case, verify that the type of connection is correct for your Internet. service. </li>
            <li>A cable modem connection will have a coaxial terminal to accept a BNC type connector. </li>
            <li>A DSL connection will have a port for telephone type cable, usually an RJ11 connector. </li>
            <li>After confirming that the computer is connected to the network router and the link lights on the NIC
                indicate a worker connection, The computer needs an IP address. </li>
            <li>Most network routers are set up so that the computer receives an IP address automatically from a local
                DHCP server automatically configured on the wireless router. </li>
            <li>If the computer does not have an IP address, check the router documentation and configure the PC or
                tablet with a unique IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS information. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="design-considerations">4.4.2 - Design Considerations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Before entering the configuration utility or manually configuring the router through a web browser, you
                should consider how your network will be used. </li>
            <li>You do not want to configure the router and have that configuration limit what you are able to do on the
                network. Nor do you want to leave your network unprotected.
            </li>
            <li>Points to consider are: <ul>
                    <li>What should my network be called? If SSID broadcasting is on, the SSID name will be seen by all
                        wireless clients within your signal range. Many times the SSID gives away too much information
                        about the network to unknown client devices. It is not good practice to include the device model
                        or brand name as part of the SSID. Wireless devices have default settings that are easy to find
                        on the Internet as well as known security weaknesses. </li>
                    <li>What type of devices will attach to my network? Wireless devices contain radio
                        transmitter/receivers that function within a specific frequency range.
                        If a device only has the necessary radio for 802.11. B/G. it will not connect If the wireless
                        router or access point is configured to only accept 802.11. AC or 802.11 N. Standards.
                        If all devices support the same standard, the network will work as at its optimum speed.
                        If you have devices that do not support the N or AC standards, then you will have to enable
                        legacy mode.
                        A legacy mode wireless network environment varies between router models, but can include a
                        combination of 802.11, a 802.11 B Eight Zero Two Eleven G, 802.11 N and 802.11 AC.
                        This environment produces easy access for legacy devices that needs a wireless connection. </li>
                    <li>How do I add new devices? The decision regarding who can access your home network should be
                        determined by how you plan to use your network. On some wireless routers, is it possible to set
                        up guest access? This is a special SSID coverage area that allows Open Access but restricts that
                        access to using the Internet. only. Note some wireless routers may label legacy mode as mix
                        mode. </li>
