    <h2>Question 1</h2>
    <p>Consider the following TMA question</p>
    <p><em>TMA Question:</em> stack of fourteen identical jigsaw puzzle boxes measures 68.5 cm high. Calculate the
        height of one jigsaw box. Give your answer in centimetres, correct to 1 decimal place.</p>

    <p>Here is a student's first attempt at a solution, with the correct numerical results:</p>
    <p><em>First Solution:</em>68.5 = 68.5/14 = 4.9 = 1 box</p>
    <p>Later the student wrote a solution to be submitted for the TMA:</p>
    <p><em>Second Solution:</em>

    <h2>Answer:
        <ul>
            <li>The student is re-writing the maths question within their solution, including link words like
                "So"</li>
            <li>Each step of the solution is on a new line and clearly laid out</li>
            <li>The student has included units within the steps and in their answer</li>
            <li>The student has used correct notation <ul>
                    <li>the ellipsis to show the original calculation resulted in numbers that have
                        been omitted, but have given enough numbers after the decimal point to show how they had rounded
                        it to 1

    <h2>Question 2</h2>
    <p>a: Alex is following a recipe to make a pavlova that uses 280 grams of
        sugar and 6 eggs. However, they drop one egg and so only have the five
        remaining eggs to use. Calculate the quantity of sugar that Alex should
        now use to make their pavlova. Give your answer in grams, correct to
        2 significant figures.</p>
    <p>Answer: The recipe states that there is 280 grams of sugar for 6 eggs.
        Therefore,
        for 1 egg there is 280/6 = 46.666... grams of sugar.
        For 5 eggs there is 5 x 46.666... = 233.333... grams of sugar.
        Rounding to 2 significant figures gives 230 grams of sugar.</p>
    <p>b: The book Is maths real? by Eugenia Cheng has 336 pages. An online
        preview of the book includes 39 pages. Calculate the percentage of
        pages that are included in the online preview. Give your answer correct
        to the nearest whole number.</p>
    <p>Answer: The book has 336 pages and the online preview has 39 pages.
        Therefore, the percentage of pages in the online preview is
        (39/336) x 100 = 11.607...%,
        which rounds to 12%.</p>
    <p>c:A farm has 140 sheep.
    <p>i: 45% of these sheep are Texel sheep. Calculate the number of Texel
        sheep on the farm.</p>
    <p>Answer: The farm has 140 sheep and 45% of these are Texel sheep.
        Therefore, the number of Texel sheep is
        (45/100) x 140 = 63 sheep.</p>
    <p>ii:Of these Texel sheep, 36 are lambs (are under 1 year old). Write
        the number of Texel lambs as a fraction of the total number of
        Texel sheep on the farm. Give your answer both as an unsimplified
        fraction, and as a fraction in its simplest form.</p>
    <p>Answer: There are 63 Texel sheep on the farm, of which 36 are lambs.
        Therefore, the number of Texel lambs as a fraction of the total number of Texel sheep is
        36/63, which simplifies to
        (36 ÷ 9)/(63 ÷ 9) = 4/7.</p>
    <p>Bo, Cal and Drew are each crocheting a scarf.</p>
    <p>i:At one point, Bo’s scarf is 87 cm long and Cal’s scarf is 19% longer
        than Bo’s. Calculate the length of Cal’s scarf. Give your answer in
        centimetres correct to the nearest centimetre. </p>
    <p>Answer: Bo’s scarf is 87 cm long, so Cal’s scarf is 19% longer than this.
        Therefore, the length of Cal’s scarf is
        87 + (19/100) x 87 = 87 x (1 + 19/100) = 87 x (119/100) = 103.53 cm,
        which rounds to 104 cm.</p>
    <p>ii: At this point, Drew’s scarf is 8/11 of the length of Cal’s scarf.
        Calculate the length of Drew’s scarf. Give your answer in
        centimetres, correct to the nearest centimetre.</p>
    <p>Answer: Cal’s scarf is 104 cm long, so Drew’s scarf is 8/11 of this
        length. Therefore, the length of Drew’s scarf is
        (8/11) x 104 = 75.636... cm,
        which rounds to 76 cm.</p>
    <p>e:The price of a first class Royal Mail stamp increased in October 2024
        from £1.35 to £1.65.</p>
    <p>i:Calculate the percentage increase in the price of a first class stamp.
        Give your answer correct to one decimal place. </p>
    <p>answer: The increase in price is £1.65 - £1.35 = £0.30.
        The percentage increase is (0.30/1.35) x 100 = 22.222...%,
        which rounds to 22.2%.</p>
    <p>ii:Explain briefly why you used the method you used to answer
        Question 2 part (e)(i), and why you laid your solution out as you
        did. </p>
    <p>Answer: To calculate the percentage increase, I first found the
        increase in price by subtracting the original price from the new price.

        Then, I divided the increase by the original price and multiplied by
        100 to get the percentage.

        I laid out my solution step-by-step to make it
        clear and easy to follow, showing each calculation and the reasoning behind it. using the GMC Guidelines to
        help me.</p>
    <h2>Question 3</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Erin completes a training ride of 28.5 kilometres in 2 hours and
            45 minutes. Calculate their average speed for this ride, giving your
            answer in kilometres per hour (km/h) correct to one decimal place
            <ul>
                <li>To find the average speed, we need to divide the total distance by the total time.</li>
                <li>First, we need to convert the time into hours. 2 hours and 45 minutes is equal to 2.75 hours
                    (since 45 minutes is 0.75 of an hour).</li>
                <li>Now we can calculate the average speed:</li>
                <li>Average speed = Total distance / Total time</li>
                <li>Average speed = 28.5 km / 2.75 hours = 10.3636... km/h</li>
                <li>Rounding to one decimal place, the average speed is 10.4 km/h.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The first bridlepath (horse riding trail) on Erin’s training ride measures
            34.6 cm on a map which has a scale of 1 : 16 000. Calculate the
            corresponding distance covered on the ground. Give your answer in
            kilometres, correct to two significant figures.<ul>
                <li>To find the corresponding distance on the ground, we can use the scale of the map.</li>
                <li>The scale 1 : 16,000 means that 1 cm on the map represents 16,000 cm on the ground.</li>
                <li>First, we need to convert the distance on the map from centimeters to centimeters on the ground:
                </li>
                <li>Distance on the ground = Distance on the map x Scale factor</li>
                <li>Distance on the ground = 34.6 cm x 16,000 = 553,600 cm</li>
                <li>Now, we need to convert centimeters to kilometers. There are 100,000 cm in a kilometer:</li>
                <li>Distance in kilometers = Distance in cm / 100,000</li>
                <li>Distance in kilometers = 553,600 cm / 100,000 = 5.536 km</li>
                <li>Rounding to two significant figures, the distance covered on the ground is 5.5 km.</li>
            </ul>
