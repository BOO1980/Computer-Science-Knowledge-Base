        Rounding Numbers</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Rounding is the process of reducing the number of significant digits in a number.</li>
        <li>Rounding is often used to make numbers easier to work with or to present them in a more concise format.</li>
        <li>There are several methods of rounding, including rounding up, rounding down, and rounding to the nearest
            integer.</li>
        <li>Rounding up means increasing the number to the next highest integer, while rounding down means decreasing
            the number to the next lowest integer.</li>
        <li>Rounding to the nearest integer means rounding the number to the closest whole number.</li>
        <li>When rounding to a specific number of decimal places, the digit in the place to the right of the desired
            decimal place is used to determine whether to round up or down.</li>
        <li>If the digit is 5 or greater, the number is rounded up. If the digit is less than 5, the number is rounded
            down.</li>
        <li>When you round a number, you just state how it's been rounded in brackets after the rounded number ie 0.32
            (to 2 d.p)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Decimal Places</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Decimal places refer to the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in a number.</li>
        <li>For example, in the number 3.14159, there are five decimal places.</li>
        <li>When rounding to a specific number of decimal places, it is important to consider
            the context in which the number will be used.</li>
        <li>For example, if a number is being used in a financial context, it may be appropriate to round to two decimal
            places to represent cents.</li>
        <li>In scientific contexts, it may be appropriate to round to a specific number of significant figures based on
            the precision of the measurement.</li>
        <li>It is also important to consider the potential impact of rounding on calculations and results.</li>
        <li>Rounding can introduce errors into calculations, so it is important to use appropriate rounding methods and
            to be aware of the potential impact on results.</li>
        <li>As an alternative to writing in brackets how you rounded a number, you
            can replace the equals sign by ≈, the ‘approximately equals’ sign</li>
        <li>where the symbol ≈ is read as ‘is approximately equal to’. However, it is usually preferable to state the
            rounding that you used.
        </li>
        <li>You should not write just
            2.3971 = 2.40,
            because this is incorrect: the numbers 2.3971 and 2.40 are not equal.</li>
        <li>There have been a few reports of fraudsters in the US using rounding to become rich. They use computer
            programs to remove tiny amounts of money from lots of bank accounts by rounding down to the nearest cent and
            putting the remaining fractions of cents into other accounts. These small amounts were not noticed as
            missing from any particular account, but they build up into a huge sum of money. This is an example of so
            called salami slicing or penny shaving fraud. In which Finn slivers and money are removed from many
            accounts. Modern day banking systems are built in checks to prevent this kind of fraud. I. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Significant Figures</h2>
    <ul></ul>
    <li>Significant figures are the digits in a number that carry meaningful information about its precision.</li>
    <li>Leading zeros (zeros to the left of the first non-zero digit) are not considered significant.</li>
    <li>Trailing zeros (zeros to the right of the last non-zero digit) are significant only if there is a decimal point
        present.</li>
    <li>For example, in the number 0.00456, there are three significant figures (4, 5, and 6).</li>
    <li>In the number 100.0, there are four significant figures (1, 0, 0, and the trailing zero after the decimal
        point).</li>
    <li>When performing calculations, it is important to keep track of significant figures to ensure the precision of
        the result.</li>
    <li>In general, the result of a calculation should be reported with the same number of significant figures as the
        measurement with the fewest significant figures.</li>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Other types of rounding</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Numbers are also sometimes rounded to the nearest 10 or 100 or 1000 and so on. </li>
        <li>The five or more rule is used to decide whether to round up or down. </li>
        <li>Rounding to a number of significant figures is often the most useful type of rounding to use. </li>
        <li>Often the measurement that you have used in a calculation give you an indication of the amount of rounding
            that you should use for your answer. </li>
        <li>When you are rounding answers, you should round no to no more significant figures than the number of
            significant figures in the least precise number in the calculation. </li>
        <li>It was reported in the New York Times in 1991 that Tina Lubin, a public servant who dealt with the fourteen
            eight billion payroll for the city government of the New York, had learnt to think of 10 million as a
            rounding error. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Estimation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Estimation is a rough calculation or approximation of a value based on limited information or data.</li>
        <li>Estimation is often used in situations where exact values are not necessary or when time or resources are
            limited.</li>
        <li>There are several methods of estimation, including rounding, using benchmarks, and using mental math.</li>
        <li>Rounding involves simplifying numbers to make them easier to work with, while using benchmarks involves
            comparing a value to a known reference point.</li>
        <li>Mental math involves performing calculations in your head without the use of a calculator or other tools.
        </li>
        <li>Estimation can be useful in a variety of contexts, including budgeting, project planning, and problem
            solving.</li>
        <li>However, it is important to recognize the limitations of estimation and to use appropriate methods and
            techniques to ensure accuracy and reliability.</li>

                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Suppose that you are planning a round trip in which
            you start at Edinburgh visit Perth and Glasgow , and return to
            Edinburgh, in a minibus whose fuel consumption is 12 kilometres per
            litre of fuel. Edinburgh to Perth is 69 km, Perth to Glasgow is 95 km, and
            Glasgow to Edinburgh is 83 km.
            <ul>
                <li>Estimate the amount of fuel needed for the trip: 25 litres</li>
                <li>Use your calculator to work out the amount of fuel needed, to the
                    nearest litre: 21 litres</li>
            </ul>

        </li>
        <li>A craftswoman makes handmade jewellery boxes. It takes her 2 hours and
            30 minutes to make each box, and 1 hour and 45 minutes to apply the
            decoration. She works for 7.5 hours each day. Suppose that you need to
            know how many working days it would take the craftswoman to make and
            decorate 48 jewellery boxes<ul>
                <li>Estimate the number of days needed: 2 boxes a day, 24 days</li>
                <li>A student typed the calculation shown below into a calculator, and
                    concluded that the number of days needed is 12. Try to identify the
                    two mistakes. [2.30 + 1.45 x48 / 7.5 = 11.58]:
                    the student didnt add the two hours together correctly. The student also
                    incorrectly multiplied the time taken to make each box by the number of boxes
                    before adding the time taken to decorate each box.
