        Percentages</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>A percentage is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. The symbol for percentage is %.</li>
        <li>To convert a percentage to a decimal, divide by 100. For example, 25% = 25 ÷ 100 = 0.25.</li>
        <li>To convert a decimal to a percentage, multiply by 100. For example, 0.75 = 0.75 × 100 = 75%.</li>
        <li>To find a percentage of a quantity, multiply the quantity by the percentage (as a decimal). For example, to
            find 20% of 50, calculate 50 × 0.20 = 10.</li>
        <li>To increase a quantity by a percentage, multiply the quantity by (1 + percentage as a decimal). For example,
            to increase 100 by 15%, calculate 100 × (1 + 0.15) = 115.</li>
        <li>To decrease a quantity by a percentage, multiply the quantity by (1 - percentage as a decimal). For example,
            to decrease 80 by 25%, calculate 80 × (1 - 0.25) = 60.</li>
        <li>The word "cent" is taken from the latin word "centum," which means "hundred."</li>
        <li> A percentage is a fraction with a
            denominator of 100. It is often written using the symbol %</li>
        <li>A percentage can be converted to a fraction or a decimal. To do this, you
            first write the percentage in the form of a fraction with denominator 100,
            then you simplify this to get a fraction, or divide out to get a decimal.</li>
        <li>To convert the other way – from a fraction or decimal to a percentage –
            you just need to multiply by 100, and your answer is a percentage.
            Because 100% = 1 </li>
        <li>It is often helpful to express one number as a percentage of another. This
            is done by expressing the first number as a fraction of the second number,
            and then converting the fraction to a percentage, by multiplying by 100,
            and the answer is a percentage</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Understanding Speed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The speed of an object
            indicates how far it travels in a particular period of time.</li>
        <li>Speed can be measured in other units as well: for example, metres per
            second or miles per hour.</li>
        <li>These are all examples of compound units,
            since they involve more than one basic unit of measurement</li>
        <li>n practice, you will not be able to travel at a constant speed for a whole
            journey, as you sometimes have to slow down, speed up or even stop to
            deal with the traffic and road conditions.</li>
        <li>Instead, the average speed for a
            journey is used in calculations.</li>
        <li>The average speed for a journey is calculated using the formula below.</li>
        <li>Average speed = Total distance / Total time</li>
        <li>With formulas such as this one, where the units are not specified, you can
            work out the unit used to measure the speed from the units for the
            distance and the time.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <p>Question 1: store is offering 15% off all electrical goods during its summer sale. What would you pay for a
        washing machine that usually costs £310?</p>
    <p>To find the sale price, first calculate 15% of £310:</p>
    <p>15% of £310 = 0.15 × £310 = £46.50</p>
    <p>Now, subtract this discount from the original price:</p>
    <p>Sale price = £310 - £46.50 = £263.50</p>
    <ul>
        <li>60% as a decimal = 0.60</li>
        <li>60% as a fraction = 60/100 = 3/5</li>
        <li>1.35 as a percentage = 1.35 × 100 = 135%</li>
        <li>1.35 as a fraction is 135/100 = 27/20 = 1 7/20</li>
        <li>3.8% as a decimal = 0.038</li>
        <li>In a survey of 1500 mature students, 465 agreed with the statement
            that higher education is vital for getting a new career. What
            percentage of the group is this?
            <ul>
                <li>465 / 1500 × 100 = 31%</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>In the survey in Example 11, 420 of the 1500 mature students said that
            their main reason for going to university was the potential to earn more
            money. What percentage of the group is this?<ul>
                <li>420 / 1500 × 100 = 28%</li>
            </ul>
