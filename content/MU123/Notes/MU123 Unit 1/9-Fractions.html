    Fractions</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>A fraction is a way to represent a part of a whole.</li>
    <li>The top number (numerator) represents how many parts we have.</li>
    <li>A fraction is written as one number over another and means the top number divided by the bottom number. </li>
    <li>Fractions which are equal in value but are written with different numerators and denominators are called
      equivalent fractions. </li>
    <li>You can find equivalent fractions for any given fraction by multiplying top and bottom by the same whole number.
    </li>
    <li>Decimal themselves are a form of fraction. They are situations. Where it is simpler to use fractions. </li>
    <li>The bottom number (denominator) represents how many equal parts the whole is divided into.</li>
    <li>Fractions can be proper (numerator < denominator), improper (numerator> denominator), or mixed (a whole number
        and a proper fraction).</li>
    <li>Fractions can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided using specific rules.</li>
    <li>A fraction. Is in its simplest form if the numerator and the denominator have no common factors other than 1.
    </li>
    <li>Addition and subtracting with fractions can be quite awkward, particularly when fractions are mixed with whole
      numbers and when the fractions have different denominators. </li>
    <li>To add two fractions with the same denominator, just add the numerators. </li>
    <li>To subtract one fraction from another where the dominators are the same, just subtract 1 numerator from the
      other. </li>
    <li>If the dominators are different, the calculation is a bit more awkward. The first thing to do is to rewrite the
      factions as equivalent factions where the dominators are the same. </li>
    <li>Sometimes you have to find equivalent fractions for all fractions in some in order that the denominators are the
      same. </li>
    <li>To multiply factions, multiply the denominators together and the numerators together, canceling any factors
      which the numerators and denominators have in common. </li>
    <li>Before considering division of fractions, it is helpful to think about division of whole numbers. </li>
    <li>To divide by a fraction, turn the fraction upside down and multiply. </li>
    <li>Turning a fraction upside down is called finding each reciprocal. </li>
    <li>Division by number is the same as multiplication by its reciprocal. </li>
    <li>In order to arithmetic with mixed numbers, it is often best to write them as a simple fraction that is one
      number over another. </li>
    <li>Multiplication or division involving mixed numbers is done by converting them to fractions first. </li>
  </ul>
