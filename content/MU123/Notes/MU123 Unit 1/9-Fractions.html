    Fractions</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>A fraction is a way to represent a part of a whole.</li>
    <li>The top number (numerator) represents how many parts we have.</li>
    <li>A fraction is written as one number over another and means the top number divided by the bottom number. </li>
    <li>Fractions which are equal in value but are written with different numerators and denominators are called
      equivalent fractions. </li>
    <li>You can find equivalent fractions for any given fraction by multiplying top and bottom by the same whole number.
    </li>
    <li>Decimal themselves are a form of fraction. They are situations. Where it is simpler to use fractions. </li>
    <li>The bottom number (denominator) represents how many equal parts the whole is divided into.</li>
    <li>Fractions can be proper (numerator < denominator), improper (numerator> denominator), or mixed (a whole number
        and a proper fraction).</li>
    <li>Fractions can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided using specific rules.</li>
    <li>A fraction. Is in its simplest form if the numerator and the denominator have no common factors other than 1.
    </li>
    <li>Addition and subtracting with fractions can be quite awkward, particularly when fractions are mixed with whole
      numbers and when the fractions have different denominators. </li>
    <li>To add two fractions with the same denominator, just add the numerators. </li>
    <li>To subtract one fraction from another where the dominators are the same, just subtract 1 numerator from the
      other. </li>
    <li>If the dominators are different, the calculation is a bit more awkward. The first thing to do is to rewrite the
      factions as equivalent factions where the dominators are the same. </li>
    <li>Sometimes you have to find equivalent fractions for all fractions in some in order that the denominators are the
      same. </li>
    <li>To multiply factions, multiply the denominators together and the numerators together, canceling any factors
      which the numerators and denominators have in common. </li>
    <li>Before considering division of fractions, it is helpful to think about division of whole numbers. </li>
    <li>To divide by a fraction, turn the fraction upside down and multiply. </li>
    <li>Turning a fraction upside down is called finding each reciprocal. </li>
    <li>Division by number is the same as multiplication by its reciprocal. </li>
    <li>In order to arithmetic with mixed numbers, it is often best to write them as a simple fraction that is one
      number over another. </li>
    <li>Multiplication or division involving mixed numbers is done by converting them to fractions first. </li>
    <li>Fractions are also important in mathematics, particularly in algebra.</li>
    <li>A fraction is a number that describes the relationship between part of
      something and the whole. </li>
    <li>The top number in a fraction is called the numerator and the bottom
      number is called the denominator</li>
    <li>To find a fraction equivalent to a given fraction. Multiply or divide the numerator and denominator by the same
      non zero number. </li>
    <h2>Simplifying fractions.</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>When you divide the top and bottom of a fraction by a whole number larger than one, you get an equivalent
        fraction with a small numerator and denominator. This is known as canceling the fraction. </li>
      <li>When a fraction has been canceled to give the smallest possible numerator and denominator but still whole
        numbers
        is said to be in its simplest form or lowest terms.
    </ul>
    <li>Fractions are often
      used in media headlines because of their impact</li>
    <li>They can make statistics more relatable and easier to understand.</li>

  </ul>
  <h2>Mixed numbers and improper fractions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A mixed number is a whole number combined with a proper fraction. For example, 2 1/2 is a mixed number.</li>
    <li>An improper fraction is a fraction where the numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator. For example,
      5/4 is an improper fraction.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Fractions of Quantities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To find a fraction of a quantity, multiply the quantity by the numerator and divide by the denominator. For
      example, to find 3/4 of 20, calculate (3 * 20) / 4 = 15.</li>
    <li>Sometimes you need to calculate fractions of quantities. For example, if
      you have a recipe that serves eight people, and you want to make it for
      three people or thirty people, say, then you have to scale the quantities of
      the ingredients.</li>
    <li>In theory you can scale any recipe to cater for a group of any size, but in
      practice you may wish to adjust your answers a little. </li>
    <li>In general, when you are using mathematics to make practical decisions, it
      is important to think about whether your calculations are appropriate for
      the situation</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>7/21 in its simplest form is: 1/3</li>
    <li>48/72 in its simplest form is: 2/3</li>
    <li>35/105 in its simplest form is: 1/3</li>
    <li>720/1200 in its simplest form is: 3/5</li>
    <li>2 5/8 as a top heavy fraction is: 21/8</li>
    <li>13/4 as a mixed number is: 3 1/4</li>
    <li>A recipe for eight people specifies 750 g of strawberries. What
      quantity of strawberries would be needed for three people?

      ans: 750/8 = 93.75
      93.75 *3 = 281.25
      280g (to 2 s.f.)</li>
    <li>4/5 of 60ml = (60/5) * 4 = 48ml</li>
    <li>5/8 of 20kg = (20/8) * 5 = 12.5kg</li>
    <li>A recipe for potato curry for 6 people uses 900 g of potatoes. If you
      are making the curry for 20 people, what quantity of potatoes do you
      need?
      ans: 900/6 = 150
      150 * 20 = 3000g = 3kg</li>
