    <h1>Negative Numbers</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A negative number is a number that is less than zero. It is represented with a minus sign (−) in front of
            the number. For example, −3 is a negative number.
        </li>
        <li>
            Negative numbers are used to represent values that are below a certain reference point, such as temperatures
            below freezing, debts, or elevations below sea level.</li>
        <li>
            On a number line, negative numbers are located to the left of zero. The further left you go, the smaller the
            value of the negative number.
        </li>
        <li>
            Negative numbers can be used in mathematical operations just like positive numbers. For example, subtracting
            a negative number is the same as adding its positive counterpart.
        </li>
        <li>

            In some contexts, negative numbers can represent opposite values. For example, in finance, a profit of $5
            can be represented as +5, while a loss of $5 can be represented as -5.
        </li>
        <li>
            When working with negative numbers, it is important to remember the rules of arithmetic. For example, when
            multiplying or dividing two negative numbers, the result is a positive number.
        </li>
        <li>
            Negative numbers are commonly used in various fields, including mathematics, physics, engineering, and
            economics.
        </li>
        <li>Negative numbers, fractions and percentages, which can be thought of as a type of fraction, occur frequently
            in both every day life and mathematics. </li>
        <li>In 2007, a lottery scratch card game was withdrawn within a week of being launched because players could not
            understand the negative numbers involved. To win a prize, players had to scratch away a window to reveal a
            temperature lower than the temperature shown on the card. As the game had a winter theme that displayed the
            temperature was usually negative, many players thought that minus 3 was lower than minus 4, for example, and
            complained to the lottery company when they thought they had won a prize, but they were told they had not.
        </li>
        <li>You may have noticed that the minus sign used to donate a negative number is shorter, closer to the number
            and raised. Compared with the minus sign used to donate subtraction. </li>


    </ul>
    <h2>Negative symbol as opposite</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The opposite of a number is the number on the other side of 0 number line, and the same distance from 0
        </li>
        <li>-4 is the opposite of 4</li>
        <li>-8 is the opposite of 8</li>
        <li>231 is the opposite of -231</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Rational Numbers of the number line</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, where the denominator is
            not
            zero. This includes both positive and negative numbers, as well as zero itself.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Absolute Value</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The absolute value of a number is its distance from 0 on the number line, regardless of direction.
        </li>
        <li>
            Absolute values are always non-negative.
        </li>
        <li>
            The absolute value of -5 is 5, and the absolute value of 5 is also 5.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Adding and subtracting negative numbers. </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No matter what number you start with. Whether it's positive, negative or zero. If you want to add a positive
            number to it, then you move along the number line to the right.</li>
        <li>If you want to add a negative number, you move to the left.</li>
        <li>For example: 5 + (−3) = 2</li>
        <li>And: (−2) + (−3) = −5</li>
        <li>To subtract a positive number, you move along the number line to the left. </li>
        <li>To subtract a negative number, you move to the right.</li>
        <li>Add in a negative number is the same subtracting the corresponding positive number. </li>
        <li>Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the corresponding positive number.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Multiplication of Negative Numbers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When you multiply two negative numbers, the result is a positive number.</li>
        <li>For example: (−2) × (−3) = 6</li>
        <li>When you multiply a negative number by a positive number, the result is a negative number.</li>
        <li>For example: (−2 ) × 3 = −6</li>
        <li>When you multiply a positive number by a negative number, the result is also a negative number.</li>
        <li>For example: 2 × (−3) = −6</li>
        <li>When you multiply two positive numbers, the result is a positive number.</li>
        <li>For example: 2 × 3 = 6</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Division of Negative Numbers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When you divide two negative numbers, the result is a positive number.</li>
        <li>For example: (−6) ÷ (−2) = 3</li>
        <li>When you divide a negative number by a positive number, the result is a negative number.</li>
        <li>For example: (−6) ÷ 2 = −3</li>
        <li>When you divide a positive number by a negative number, the result is also a negative number.</li>
        <li>For example: 6 ÷ (−2) = −3</li>
        <li>When you divide two positive numbers, the result is a positive number.</li>
        <li>For example: 6 ÷ 2 = 3</li>
    </ul>
