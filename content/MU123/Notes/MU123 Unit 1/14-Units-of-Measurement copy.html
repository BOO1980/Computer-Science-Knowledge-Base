        Units of Measurement</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Many everyday calculations involve measurements of some kind.</li>
        <li>For example, lengths, times, amounts of money and so on.</li>
        <li>In the UK both the metric and imperial systems of measurement are used.</li>
        <li>In the metric system, the different units for the same type of quantity are related to each other via powers
            of ten: for example, 1 meter is the same as 100 (or 10<sup>2</sup>) centimeters.</li>
        <li>In the US, metre is spelled METER. </li>
        <li>In the Imperial system, the units are related in different ways. For example, one stone is the same as 14
            pounds. </li>
        <li>The metric system was founded in France in the wake of the French Revolution, and work on SI units has been
            ongoing since the middle of the 20th century. </li>
        <li>To the time of writing that only countries who have not adopted SI units as their sole or primary system of
            measurement of the United States, Burma and Liberia. </li>
        <li>There are seven base senior units from which all the other units are derived. </li>
        <li>The base units are:
            <ul>
                <li>metre (m)</li>
                <li>kilogram (kg)</li>
                <li>second (s)</li>
                <li>ampere (A) </li>
                <li>kelvin (K)</li>
                <li>mole (mol)</li>
                <li>candela (cd)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When you make a measurement, it is sometimes helpful to round your answer. Rounding can make it easier to
            work with the number and can help to avoid errors in calculations.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Converting units</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To convert between different units of the same type of quantity, you need to know the relationship between
            the two units.</li>
        <li>For example, to convert from meters to centimeters, you need to know that 1 meter is the same as 100
            centimeters.</li>
        <li>To convert from one unit to another, you can use a conversion factor. A conversion factor is a fraction that
            represents the relationship between two units.</li>
        <li>For example, to convert from meters to centimeters, you can use the conversion factor 100 cm / 1 m. To
            convert a measurement in meters to centimeters, you multiply the measurement by the conversion factor:</li>
        <li>Measurement in cm = Measurement in m × (100 cm / 1 m)</li>
        <li>For example, to convert 2.5 meters to centimeters:</li>
        <li>Measurement in cm = 2.5 m × (100 cm / 1 m) = 250 cm</li>
        <li>You can also use conversion factors to convert from larger units to smaller units. For example, to convert
            from kilometers to meters, you can use the conversion factor 1000 m / 1 km. To convert a measurement in
            kilometers to meters, you multiply the measurement by the conversion factor:</li>
        <li>Measurement in m = Measurement in km × (1000 m / 1 km)</li>
        <li>For example, to convert 3.2 kilometers to meters:</li>
        <li>Measurement in m = 3.2 km × (1000 m / 1 km) = 3200 m</li>
        <li>To convert from one unit to another, you should first find out how many of the smaller units are equivalent
            to one of the larger units. </li>
        <li>If the units are metric, then you can tell this from the prefixes. For example, 1 kilometer is equal to 1000
            meters, so the prefix "kilo-" indicates a factor of 1000.</li>
        <li>If you want to convert to the smaller unit, then there will be more of these units, so you need to multiply
            by this number. </li>
        <li>If you want to convert to the larger unit then there will be few of these units. So you need to divide by
            the number. </li>
        <li>A few other metric units are commonly used alongside the SI units. These include:<ul>
                <li>Electric tonne (t) - a unit of mass equal to 1000 kilograms.</li>
                <li>Liter (L) - a unit of volume equal to 1 cubic decimeter.</li>
                <li>Kelvin (K) - a unit of temperature.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Time is also often measured in non metric units. You have probably never heard of a kilo second. </li>
        <li>The UK has embraced metric units rather less enthusiastically than most other countries, and many of its
            traditional imperial units are still used. </li>
        <li>If you live in the UK, you may be comfortable with measuring kitchen cabinets in millimeters and buying
            petrol in liters. </li>
        <li>But you may think of your height in feet and inches and your weight in stones and pounds. </li>
        <li>More seriously. NASA lost the Mars Climate Orbiter spacecraft
            in 1999 as a result of an error caused because one team working in the project used Imperial new units of
            management, while others use metric. </li>
        <li>In 1969, the UK government set up the Metrication Board with the aim of ensuring substantial adoption of
            metric units in the UK by 1975. </li>
        <li>Remember to include units in your answers. </li>
        <li>Check whether you are asked to give your answers in particular units. </li>
    </ul>I. I. I. **** hate these guys. Safe. Stop it. Stop it. Dial. Shut up.
