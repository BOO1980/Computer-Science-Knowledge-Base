        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>here are some estimates
                for the time for the car journey between Great Malvern and Milton
                Keynes, provided by different route planners using various routes:
                1 h 36 min, 1 h 58 min, 2 h 3 min, 2 h 5 min, 2 h 8 min, 2 h 19 min,
                2 h 21 min, 2 h 33 min, 2 h 48 min, 3 h 19 min.<ul>
                    <li>Why might the route planners estimate different times for the
                        journey?
                        ans: Different route planners may use different algorithms, traffic data,
                        and assumptions about driving conditions, leading to varying estimates.
                    </li>
                    <li>From Figure 1, the distance in a straight line between Great Malvern
                        and Milton Keynes appears to be just over 100 kilometres. Assuming
                        that the car travels about 50 kilometres in an hour, what is an
                        estimate for the journey time? Do you think this estimate is good
                        enough for planning the time to set off?
                        ans: An estimate based on a straight-line distance of just over 100
                        kilometres at 50 kilometres per hour would be just over 2 hours. This
                        estimate may not account for factors such as traffic, road conditions,
                        and stops along the way, so it might be wise to allow extra time.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>
                The map is scaled 20km per 2cm (10 km/cm).
                <ul>
                    <li>On the map, the distance along the route from Great Malvern to
                        Milton Keynes is 13.8 cm, and the distance along the motorway
                        section of the route is 3 cm (to the nearest mm). What are the
                        corresponding ground distances, in kilometres?

                        ans: The total distance from Great Malvern to Milton Keynes is 138
                        kilometres (13.8 cm * 10 km/cm). The motorway section is 30
                        kilometres (3 cm * 10 km/cm).</li>
                    <li>Apart from the section on the motorway, the rest of the route is on
                        principal roads. Use your answers to part (a) to find the distance on
                        the principal roads, in kilometres

                        ans: The distance on principal roads is 108 kilometres (138 km - 30
                        km).</li>
                    <li>What distance on the map represents 25 km on the ground?
                        ans: 2.5 cm on the map represents 25 km on the ground (25 km / 10
                        km/cm).</li>

            <li>A map scale is given as ‘1 cm represents 10 km’. What is the scale
                factor?<ul>
                    <li>10 km = (10 x 1000)</li>

            <li>Suppose that a car travels a distance of 75 km in 45 minutes on a
                motorway. What is its average speed? Give your answer in km/h.<ul>
                    <li>First, convert 45 minutes to hours: 45 minutes = 45/60 hours = 0.75 hours.</li>
                    <li>Now, use the formula for average speed: Average speed = Total distance / Total time.</li>
                    <li>Average speed = 75 km / 0.75 hours = 100 km/h.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>A journey of 425 km on the motorway that takes 4 hours<ul>
                            <li>Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 425 km / 4 hours = 106.25 km/h</li>
                            <li>Rounding to two significant figures gives 110 km/h.</li>

                            <li>First, convert 1 hour 25 minutes to hours: 1 hour 25 minutes = 1 + 25/60 = 1.4167 hours.

                            <li>Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 30 km / 1.4167 hours = 21.14 km/h.</li>
